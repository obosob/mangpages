.TH "RDISC" "8" "23 June 2014" "iputils-140519" "System Managerz Manual: iputils"
.SH NAME
rdisc \- network routa discovery daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBrdisc\fR [\fB-abdfrstvV\fR] [\fB-p \fIpreference\fB\fR] [\fB-T \fImax_interval\fB\fR] [\fB\fIsend_address\fB\fR] [\fB\fIreceive_address\fB\fR]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBrdisc\fR implements client side of tha ICMP routa discover protocol.
\fBrdisc\fR is invoked at boot time ta populate tha network
routin tablez wit default routes. 
.PP
\fBrdisc\fR listens on tha ALL_HOSTS (224.0.0.1) multicast address
(or \fIreceive_address\fR provided it is given) 
for ROUTER_ADVERTISE lyrics from routers. Da received
lyrics is handled by first ignorin dem listed routa addresses
with which tha host do not share a network fo' realz. Among tha remainin addresses
the ones wit tha highest preference is selected as default routers
and a thugged-out default route is entered up in tha kernel routin table
for each one of em.
.PP
Optionally, \fBrdisc\fR can avoid waitin fo' routas ta announce 
themselves by bustin  up all dem ROUTER_SOLICITATION lyrics
to tha ALL_ROUTERS (224.0.0.2) multicast address 
(or \fIsend_address\fR provided it is given) 
when it is started.
.PP
A timer be associated wit each routa address n' tha address will
no longer be considered fo' inclusion up in tha the routin tablez if tha 
timer expires before a freshly smoked up 
\fBadvertise\fR message is received from tha router.
Da address will also be excluded from consideration if tha host receives a 
\fBadvertise\fR
message wit tha preference bein maximally negative.
.PP
Server side of routa discovery protocol is supported by Cisco IOS
and by any mo' or less complete UNIX routin daemon, f.e \fBgated\fR.
Or, \fBrdisc\fR can act as responder, if compiled wit -DRDISC_SERVER.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-a\fR
Accept all routas independently of tha preference they have up in they 
\fBadvertise\fR lyrics.
Normally \fBrdisc\fR only accepts (and entas up in tha kernel routing
tables) tha routa or routas wit tha highest preference.
.TP
\fB-b\fR
Opposite ta \fB-a\fR, i.e. install only routa wit tha best
preference value. Well shiiiit, it is default behaviour.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Send debuggin lyrics ta syslog.
.TP
\fB-f\fR
Run \fBrdisc\fR forever even if no routas is found.
Normally \fBrdisc\fR gives up if it has not received any 
\fBadvertise\fR message afta afta solicitin three times,
in which case it exits wit a non-zero exit code.
If \fB-f\fR aint specified up in tha straight-up original gangsta form then 
\fB-s\fR must be specified.
.TP
\fB-r\fR
Responder mode, available only if compiled wit -DRDISC_SERVER.
.TP
\fB-s\fR
Send three \fBsolicitation\fR lyrics initially ta quickly discover
the routas when tha system is booted.
When \fB-s\fR is specified \fBrdisc\fR
exits wit a non-zero exit code if it can not find any routers.
This can be overridden wit tha \fB-f\fR option.
.TP
\fB-p \fIpreference\fB\fR
Set preference up in advertisement.
Available only wit -r option.
.TP
\fB-T \fImax_interval\fB\fR
Set maximum advertisement interval up in seconds.  Default is 600 secs.
Available only wit -r option.
.TP
\fB-t\fR
Test mode. Do not git all up in background.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Be verbose i.e. bust fuckin shitloadz of debuggin lyrics ta syslog.
.TP
\fB-V\fR
Print version n' exit.

and bust ICMP lyrics n' capabilitizzle CAP_NET_ADMIN
to update routin tables.
