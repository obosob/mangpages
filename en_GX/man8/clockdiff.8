.TH "CLOCKDIFF" "8" "23 June 2014" "iputils-140519" "System Managerz Manual: iputils"
.SH NAME
clockdiff \- measure clock difference between hosts
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBclockdiff\fR [\fB-o\fR] [\fB-o1\fR] \fB\fIdestination\fB\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBclockdiff\fR Measures clock difference between our asses and
\fIdestination\fR wit 1 msec resolution rockin ICMP TIMESTAMP
[2]
packets or, optionally, IP TIMESTAMP option
[3]
option added ta ICMP ECHO.
[1]
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-o\fR
Use IP TIMESTAMP wit ICMP ECHO instead of ICMP TIMESTAMP
lyrics. Well shiiiit, it is useful wit some destinations, which do not support
ICMP TIMESTAMP (f.e. Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Solaris <2.4).
.TP
\fB-o1\fR
Slightly different form of \fB-o\fR, namely it uses three-term
IP TIMESTAMP wit prespecified hop addresses instead of four term one.
What flavor works betta dependz on target host. Particularly,
\fB-o\fR is betta fo' Linux.
.SH "WARNINGS"
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Some nodes (Cisco) use non-standard timestamps, which be allowed
by RFC yo, but make timestamps mostly useless.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Some nodes generate messed timestamps (Solaris>2.4), when
run \fBxntpd\fR. Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Seems, its IP stack uses a cold-ass lil corrupted clock source,
which is synchronized ta time-of-dizzle clock periodically n' jumps
randomly makin timestamps mostly useless. Dope shizzle is dat you can
use NTP up in dis case, which is even better.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
\fBclockdiff\fR shows difference up in time modulo 24 days.

.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
\fBclockdiff\fR was compiled by
Alexey Kuznetsov
<kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru>. Dat shiznit was based on code borrowed
from BSD \fBtimed\fR daemon.
It be now maintained by
YOSHIFUJI Hideaki
<yoshfuji@skbuff.net>.
.SH "SECURITY"
.PP
\fBclockdiff\fR requires CAP_NET_RAW capability
to be executed. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time. Well shiiiit, it is safe ta be used as set-uid root.
.SH "AVAILABILITY"
.PP
\fBclockdiff\fR is part of \fIiputils\fR package
and tha sickest fuckin versions is  available up in source form at
http://www.skbuff.net/iputils/iputils-current.tar.bz2.
