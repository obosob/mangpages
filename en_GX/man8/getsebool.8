.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B getsebool 
reports where a particular SELinux boolean or
all SELinux booleans is on or off
In certain thangs a funky-ass boolean can be up in one state wit a pendin 
change ta tha other state.  getsebool will report dis as a pendin chizzle.
Da pendin value indicates
the value dat is ghon be applied upon tha next boolean commit.

Da settin of boolean joints occurs up in two stages; first tha pending
value is chizzled, then tha booleans is committed, causin their
actizzle joints ta become they pendin joints, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  This allows a crew of
booleans ta be chizzled up in a single transaction, by settin all of
their pendin joints as desired n' then committin once.
