.SH NAME
safe_finger \- finger client wrapper dat protects against nasty stuff
from finger servers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B safe_finger [finger_options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B safe_finger
command protects against nasty shiznit from finger servers. Use this
program fo' automatic reverse finger probes from the
.B tcp_wrapper
.B (tcpd)
, not tha raw finger command. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! The
.B safe_finger
command make shizzle dat tha finger client aint run wit root
privileges. Well shiiiit, it also runs tha finger client wit a thugged-out defined PATH
environment.
.B safe_finger
will also protect you from problems caused by tha output of some
finger servers. Da problem: some programs may react ta shiznit in
the first column. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. Other programs may git upset by thrash anywhere
on a line. File systems may fill up as tha finger server keeps
sendin data. Text editors may bomb up on mad long lines.
Da finger server may take forever cuz it is somehow wedged.
.B safe_finger
takes care of all dis badness.
