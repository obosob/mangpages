wpa_background \- Background shiznit on Wi-Fi Protected Access n' IEEE 802.11i
.SH "WPA"
.PP
Da original gangsta securitizzle mechanizzle of IEEE 802.11 standard was
not designed ta be phat n' has proven ta be insufficient for
most networks dat require some kind of security. Task crew I
(Security) of IEEE 802.11 hustlin group
(http://www.ieee802.org/11/) has hit dat shiznit ta address tha flaws of
the base standard n' has up in practice completed its work up in May
2004. Da IEEE 802.11i amendment ta tha IEEE 802.11 standard was
approved up in June 2004 n' published up in July 2004.
.PP
Wi-Fi Alliizzle (http://www.wi-fi.org/) used a thugged-out draft version
of tha IEEE 802.11i work (draft 3.0) ta define a subset of the
securitizzle enhancements dat can be implemented wit existin wlan
hardware. This is called Wi-Fi Protected Access<TM> (WPA). This
has now become a mandatory component of interoperabilitizzle testing
and certification done by Wi-Fi Alliance. Wi-Fi provides
information bout WPA at its wizzy crib
(http://www.wi-fi.org/OpenSection/protected_access.asp).
.PP
IEEE 802.11 standard defined wired equivalent privacy (WEP)
algorithm fo' protectin wireless networks. WEP uses RC4 with
40-bit keys, 24-bit initialization vector (IV), n' CRC32 to
protect against packet forgery fo' realz. All these chizzlez have proven to
be insufficient: key space is too lil' small-ass against current attacks,
RC4 key schedulin is insufficient (beginnin of tha pseudorandom
stream should be skipped), IV space is too lil' small-ass n' IV reuse
makes attacks easier, there is no replay protection, n' non-keyed
authentication do not protect against bit flippin packet
data.
.PP
WPA be a intermediate solution fo' tha securitizzle issues. It
uses Temporal Key Integritizzle Protocol (TKIP) ta replace WEP. TKIP
is a cold-ass lil compromise on phat securitizzle n' possibilitizzle ta use existing
hardware. Well shiiiit, it still uses RC4 fo' tha encryption like WEP yo, but with
per-packet RC4 keys. In addition, it implements replay protection,
keyed packet authentication mechanizzle (Mike MIC).
.PP
Keys can be managed rockin two different mechanisms. WPA can
either use a external authentication server (e.g., RADIUS) and
EAP just like IEEE 802.1X is rockin or pre-shared keys without need
for additionizzle servers. Wi-Fi calls these "WPA-Enterprise" and
"WPA-Personal", respectively. Both mechanizzlez will generate a
masta session key fo' tha Authenticator (AP) n' Supplicant
(client station).
.PP
WPA implements a freshly smoked up key handshake (4-Way Handshake and
Group Key Handshake) fo' generatin n' exchangin data encryption
keys between tha Authenticator n' Supplicant. This handshake is
also used ta verify dat both Authenticator n' Supplicant know
the masta session key. These handshakes is identical regardless
of tha selected key pimpment mechanizzle (only tha method for
generatin masta session key chizzles).
.SH "IEEE 802.11I / WPA2"
.PP
Da design fo' partz of IEEE 802.11i dat was not included
in WPA has finished (May 2004) n' dis amendment ta IEEE 802.11
was approved up in June 2004. Wi-Fi Alliizzle is rockin tha final IEEE
802.11i as a freshly smoked up version of WPA called WPA2. This includes, e.g.,
support fo' mo' robust encryption algorithm (CCMP: AES up in Counter
mode wit CBC-MAC) ta replace TKIP n' optimizations fo' handoff
(reduced number of lyrics up in initial key handshake,
pre-authentication, n' PMKSA caching).
