.SH NAME
rpmdev-rmdevelrpms \- manual page fo' rpmdev-rmdevelrpms version 1.14
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rpmdev-rmdevelrpms
[\fIoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
rpmdev\-rmdevelrpms be a script fo' findin n' optionally removing
"development" packages, fo' example fo' cleanup purposes before startin to
build a freshly smoked up package.
.PP
By default, tha followin packages is treated as pimpment ones n' are
thus muthafuckas fo' removal: any package whose name matches "\-devel\eb",
"\-debuginfo\eb", "\-sdk\eb", or "\-static\eb" (case insensitively) except gcc
requirements; any package whose name starts wit "perl\-(Devel|ExtUtils|Test)\-";
any package whose name starts wit "compat\-gcc"; packages up in tha internal list
of known pimpment oriented packages (see def_devpkgs up in tha source code);
packages determined ta be pimpment ones based on some basic heuristic
checks on tha packagez contents.
.PP
Da default set of packages above aint intended ta not reduce a system into
a minimal clean build root yo, but ta keep it usable fo' general purposes while
gettin rid of a reasonably big-ass set of pimpment packages.  Da package
set operated on can be configured ta hook up various scenarios.
.PP
To include additionizzle packages up in tha list of ones treated as pimpment
packages, use tha "devpkgs" option up in tha configuration file.  To exclude
packages from tha list use "nondevpkgs" up in dat shit.  Exclusion overrides inclusion.
.PP
Da system wide configuration file is \fI/etc/rpmdevtools/rmdevelrpms.conf\fP,
and per user settings (which override system ones) can be specified in
~/.config/rpmdevtools/rmdevelrpms.conf or ~/.rmdevelrpmsrc (deprecated).
These filez is freestyled up in Python.
