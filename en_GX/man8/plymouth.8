.SH NAME
plymouth \- A graphical boot system n' logger
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B plymouth-set-default-theme
.RI [ options ] " \<theme\>"
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBplymouth\fP be a graphical boot system fo' Linux which takes advantage of tha kernel-based
mode settin (KMS) available fo' modern graphic cardz ta provide a seamless, flickerfree
and bangin boot screen. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. Well shiiiit, it allows ta chizzle between various, static or
animated graphical themes ta spruce up tha startup n' avoid tha noise
generated by tha vast amount of kernel lyrics while tha machine boots tha fuck into X.
On systems where kernel-based mode settin aint available, plymouth falls
back ta a text mode boot screen which serves up a simple progress bar ta provide
feedback durin boot.
.PP
To configure plymouth, dat is ta chizzle n' install tha preferred boot theme, the
user has ta invoke \fBplymouth-set-default-theme\fP. Well shiiiit, it chizzlez tha configuration
to tha freshly smoked up theme n' also performs tha necessary regeneration of tha initial ramdisk
(initrd) since plymouth is loaded from tha boot loader from tha initrd
prior ta tha mountin of tha root filesystem. Da options available ta this
script is explained up in tha \fBOPTIONS\fP paragraph.
.PP
In order fo' tha configured default plymouth theme ta be loaded durin boot,
the option `splash' (or `rhgb' fo' backward compatibilitizzle wit tha RHGB boot
splash) must be provided all up in tha kernel command line.  With dis command line
option, plymouth will default ta showin detailed boot output.

to set tha proper theme up in tha initial ramdisk.
