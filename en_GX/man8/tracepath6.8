.TH "TRACEPATH" "8" "23 June 2014" "iputils-140519" "System Managerz Manual: iputils"
.SH NAME
tracepath, tracepath6 \- traces path ta a network host discoverin MTU along dis path
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBtracepath\fR [\fB-n\fR] [\fB-b\fR] [\fB-l \fIpktlen\fB\fR] [\fB-m \fImax_hops\fB\fR] [\fB-p \fIport\fB\fR] \fB\fIdestination\fB\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
It traces path ta \fIdestination\fR discoverin MTU along dis path.
It uses UDP port \fIport\fR or some random port.
It be similar ta \fBtraceroute\fR, only do not require superuser
privileges n' has no fancy options.
.PP
\fBtracepath6\fR is phat replacement fo' \fBtraceroute6\fR
and funky-ass example of application of Linux error queues.
Da thang wit IPv4 is worse, cuz commercial
IP routas do not return enough shiznit up in ICMP error lyrics.
Probably, it will chizzle, when they is ghon be updated.
For now it uses Van Jacobsonz trick, sweepin a range
of UDP ports ta maintain trace history.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-n\fR
Print primarily IP addresses numerically.
.TP
\fB-b\fR
Print both of host names n' IP addresses.
.TP
\fB-l\fR
Sets tha initial packet length ta \fIpktlen\fR instead of
65535 fo' \fBtracepath\fR or 128000 fo' \fBtracepath6\fR.
.TP
\fB-m\fR
Set maximum hops (or maximum TTLs) ta \fImax_hops\fR
instead of 30.
.TP
\fB-p\fR
Sets tha initial destination port ta use.
.SH "OUTPUT"

.PP
Da first column shows TTL of tha probe, followed by colon.
Usually value of TTL is obtained from reply from network,
but sometimes reply do not contain necessary shiznit and
we gotta guess dat shit. In dis case tha number is followed by ?.
.PP
Da second column shows tha network hop, which replied ta tha probe.
It be either address of routa or word [LOCALHOST], if
the probe was not busted ta tha network.
.PP
Da rest of line shows miscellaneous shiznit bout path to
the correspindin network hop fo' realz. As rule it gotz nuff value of RTT.
Additionally, it can show Path MTU, when it chizzles.
If tha path be asymmetric
or tha probe finishes before it reach prescribed hop, difference
between number of hops up in forward n' backward direction is shown
followin keyword async. This shiznit aint reliable.
F.e. tha third line shows asymmetry of 1, it is cuz tha straight-up original gangsta probe
with TTL of 2 was rejected all up in tha straight-up original gangsta hop cuz of Path MTU Discovery.
.PP
Da last line summarizes shiznit bout all tha path ta tha destination,
it shows detected Path MTU, amount of hops ta tha destination n' our
guess bout amount of hops from tha destination ta us, which can be
different when tha path be asymmetric.

.SH "AUTHOR"
.PP
\fBtracepath\fR was freestyled by
Alexey Kuznetsov
<kuznet@ms2.inr.ac.ru>.
.SH "SECURITY"
.PP
No securitizzle issues.
.PP
This lapidary deserves ta be elaborated.
\fBtracepath\fR aint a privileged program, unlike
\fBtraceroute\fR, \fBping\fR n' other beastz of dis kind.
\fBtracepath\fR may be executed by all dem fools dat has some access
to network, enough ta bust UDP datagrams ta investigated destination
usin given port.
.SH "AVAILABILITY"
.PP
\fBtracepath\fR is part of \fIiputils\fR package
and tha sickest fuckin versions is  available up in source form at
http://www.skbuff.net/iputils/iputils-current.tar.bz2.
