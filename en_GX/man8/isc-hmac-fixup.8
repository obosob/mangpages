.SH "NAME"
isc\-hmac\-fixup \- fixes HMAC keys generated by olda versionz of BIND
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 15
\fBisc\-hmac\-fixup\fR {\fIalgorithm\fR} {\fIsecret\fR}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Versionz of BIND 9 up ta n' includin BIND 9.6 had a funky-ass bug causin HMAC\-SHA* TSIG keys which was longer than tha digest length of tha hash algorithm (i.e., SHA1 keys longer than 160 bits, SHA256 keys longer than 256 bits, etc) ta be used incorrectly, generatin a message authentication code dat was incompatible wit other DNS implementations.
.PP
This bug has been fixed up in BIND 9.7. But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat tha fix may cause incompatibilitizzle between olda n' newer versionz of BIND, when rockin long keys.
\fBisc\-hmac\-fixup\fR
modifies dem keys ta restore compatibility.
.PP
To modify a key, run
\fBisc\-hmac\-fixup\fR
and specify tha keyz algorithm n' secret on tha command line. If tha secret is longer than tha digest length of tha algorithm (64 bytes fo' SHA1 all up in SHA256, or 128 bytes fo' SHA384 n' SHA512), then a freshly smoked up secret is ghon be generated consistin of a hash digest of tha oldschool secret. (If tha secret did not require conversion, then it is ghon be printed without modification.)
.SH "SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS"
.PP
Secrets dat done been converted by
\fBisc\-hmac\-fixup\fR
are shortened yo, but as dis is how tha fuck tha HMAC protocol works up in operation anyway, it do not affect security. RFC 2104 notes, "Keys longer than [the digest length] is aaight but tha extra length would not hella increase tha function strength."
