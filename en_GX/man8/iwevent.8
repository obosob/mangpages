.SH DESCRIPTION
.B iwevent
displays Wireless Events received all up in tha RTNetlink socket. Each
line displays tha specific Wireless Event which raps bout what tha fuck has
happened on tha specified wireless intercourse.
.br
This command don't take any arguments.

.\" DISPLAY part

.SH DISPLAY
There is two classez of Wireless Events.
.PP
Da first class is events related ta a cold-ass lil chizzle of wireless settings on
the intercourse (typically done through
.B iwconfig
or a script calling
.BR iwconfig ).
Only settings dat could result up in a gangbangin' finger-lickin' disruption of connectivitizzle are
reported. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time. Da events currently reported is changin one of the
followin settin :
.br
.I "	Network ID"
.br
.I "	ESSID"
.br
.I "	Frequency"
.br
.I "	Mode"
.br
.I "	Encryption"
.br
All dem events is ghon be generated on all wireless intercourses by the
kernel wireless subsystem (but only if tha driver has been converted
to tha freshly smoked up driver API).
.PP
Da second class of events is events generated by tha hardware, when
suttin' happens or a task has been finished. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Those events include :
.TP
.B New Access Point/Cell address
Da intercourse has joined a freshly smoked up Access Point or Ad-Hoc Cell, or lost
its association wit dat shit. This is tha same ol' dirty address dat is reported
by
.BR iwconfig .
.TP
.B Scan request completed
A scannin request has been completed, thangs up in dis biatch of tha scan are
available (see
.BR iwlist ).
.TP
.B Tx packet dropped
A packet pimped up at dis address has been dropped cuz the
interface believes dis node don't answer no mo' (usually maximum
of MAC level retry exceeded). This is probably a early indication that
the node may have left tha cell or gone outta range yo, but it may be
due ta fadin or excessive contention.
.TP
.B Custom driver event
Event specific ta tha driver n' shit. Please check tha driver documentation.
.TP
.B Registered node
Da intercourse has successfully registered a freshly smoked up wireless
client/peer n' shit. Will be generated mostly when tha intercourse acts as an
Access Point (mode Master).
.TP
.B Expired node
Da registration of tha client/peer on dis intercourse has
expired. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Will be generated mostly when tha intercourse acts as a Access
Point (mode Master).
.TP
.B Spy threshold crossed
Da signal strength fo' one of tha addresses up in tha spy list went
under tha low threshold or went above tha high threshold.
.PP
Most wireless drivers generate only a subset of dem events, not all
of them, tha exact list dependz on tha specific hardware/driver
combination. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. Please refer ta driver documentation fo' details on when
they is generated, n' use
.IR iwlist (8)
to check what tha fuck tha driver supports.
