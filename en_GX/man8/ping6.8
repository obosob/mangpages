.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBping\fR uses tha ICMP protocolz mandatory ECHO_REQUEST
datagram ta elicit a ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from a host or gateway.
ECHO_REQUEST datagrams (``pings'') have a IP n' ICMP
header, followed by a struct timeval n' then a arbitrary
number of ``pad'' bytes used ta fill up tha packet.
.PP
\fBping6\fR is IPv6 version of \fBping\fR, n' can also bust Node Hype Queries (RFC4620).
Intermediate \fIhop\fRs may not be allowed, cuz IPv6 source routin was deprecated (RFC5095).
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-a\fR
Audible ping.
.TP
\fB-A\fR
Adaptizzle ping. Interpacket interval adapts ta round-trip time, so that
effectively not mo' than one (or more, if preload is set) unanswered probe
is present up in tha network. Minimal interval is 200msec fo' not super-user.
On networks wit low rtt dis mode is essentially equivalent ta flood mode.  
.TP
\fB-b\fR
Allow pingin a funky-ass broadcast address.
.TP
\fB-B\fR
Do not allow \fBping\fR ta chizzle source address of probes.
Da address is bound ta one selected when \fBping\fR starts.
.TP
\fB-c \fIcount\fB\fR
Quit afta bustin  \fIcount\fR ECHO_REQUEST
packets, n' you can put dat on yo' toast. With 
\fIdeadline\fR
option, \fBping\fR waits for
\fIcount\fR ECHO_REPLY packets, until tha timeout expires.
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Set tha SO_DEBUG option on tha socket bein used.
Essentially, dis socket option aint used by Linux kernel. 
.TP
\fB-D\fR
Print timestamp (unix time + microsecondz as up in gettimeofday) before
each line.
.TP
\fB-f\fR
Flood ping. For every last muthafuckin ECHO_REQUEST busted a period ``.'' is printed,
while fo' eva ECHO_REPLY received a funky-ass backspace is printed.
This serves up a rapid display of how tha fuck nuff packets is bein dropped.
If interval aint given, it sets interval ta zero and
outputs packets as fast as they come back or one hundred times per second,
whichever is more.
Only tha super-user may use dis option wit zero interval.
.TP
\fB-F \fIflow label\fB\fR
\fBping6\fR only.
Allocate n' set 20 bit flow label (in hex) on echo request packets.
If value is zero, kernel allocates random flow label.
.TP
\fB-h\fR
Show help.
.TP
\fB-i \fIinterval\fB\fR
Wait \fIinterval\fR secondz between bustin  each packet.
Da default is ta wait fo' one second between each packet normally,
or not ta wait up in flood mode. Only super-user may set interval
to joints less 0.2 seconds.
.TP
\fB-I \fIinterface\fB\fR
\fIinterface\fR is either a address, or a intercourse name.
If \fIinterface\fR be a address, it sets source address
to specified intercourse address.
If \fIinterface\fR up in a intercourse name, it sets
source intercourse ta specified intercourse.
For \fBping6\fR, when bustin pin ta a link-local scope
address, link justification (by tha '%'-notation in
\fIdestination\fR, or by dis option) is required.
.TP
\fB-l \fIpreload\fB\fR
If \fIpreload\fR is specified,
\fBping\fR sendz dat nuff packets not waitin fo' reply.
Only tha super-user may select preload mo' than 3.
.TP
\fB-L\fR
Suppress loopback of multicast packets, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  This flag only applies if tha ping
destination be a multicast address.
.TP
\fB-m \fImark\fB\fR
use \fImark\fR ta tag tha packets goin out. This is useful
for variety of reasons within tha kernel like fuckin rockin policy
routin ta select specific outbound processing.
.TP
\fB-M \fIpmtudisc_opt\fB\fR
Select Path MTU Discovery game.
\fIpmtudisc_option\fR may be either \fIdo\fR
(prohibit fragmentation, even local one), 
\fIwant\fR (do PMTU discovery, fragment locally when packet size
is large), or \fIdont\fR (do not set DF flag).
.TP
\fB-N \fInodeinfo_option\fB\fR
\fBping6\fR only.
Send ICMPv6 Node Hype Queries (RFC4620), instead of Echo Request.
.RS
.TP
\fBhelp\fR
Show help fo' NI support.
.RE
.RS
.TP
\fBname\fR
Queries fo' Node Names.
.RE
.RS
.TP
\fBipv6\fR

\fBsubject-name=\fInodename\fB\fR
Subject name.  If it gotz nuff mo' than one dot,
fully-qualified domain name be assumed.
.RE
.RS
.TP
\fBsubject-fqdn=\fInodename\fB\fR
Subject name.  Fully-qualified domain name is
always assumed.
.RE
.TP
\fB-n\fR
Numeric output only.
No attempt is ghon be made ta lookup symbolic names fo' host addresses.
.TP
\fB-O\fR
Report outstandin ICMP ECHO reply before bustin  next packet.
This is useful together wit tha timestamp \fB-D\fR to
log output ta a gangbangin' finger-lickin' diagnostic file n' search fo' missin lyrics.
.TP
\fB-p \fIpattern\fB\fR
Yo ass may specify up ta 16 ``pad'' bytes ta fill up tha packet you send.
This is useful fo' diagnosin data-dependent problems up in a network.
For example, \fB-p ff\fR will cause tha busted packet
to be filled wit all ones.
.TP
\fB-q\fR
Quiet output.
Nothang is displayed except tha summary lines at startup time and
when finished.
.TP
\fB-Q \fItos\fB\fR
Set Qualitizzle of Service -related bits up in ICMP datagrams.
\fItos\fR can be decimal (\fBping\fR only) or hex number.

In RFC2474, these fieldz is interpreted as 8-bit Differentiated
Skillz (DS), consistin of: bits 0-1 (2 lowest bits) of separate
data, n' bits 2-7 (highest 6 bits) of Differentiated Skillz
Codepoint (DSCP).  In RFC2481 n' RFC3168, bits 0-1 is used fo' ECN.

Historically (RFC1349, obsoleted by RFC2474), these was interpreted
as: bit 0 (lowest bit) fo' reserved (currently bein redefined as
congestion control), 1-4 fo' Type of Service n' bits 5-7
(highest bits) fo' Precedence.
.TP
\fB-r\fR
Bypass tha aiiight routin tablez n' bust directly ta a host on a attached
interface.
If tha host aint on a gangbangin' finger-lickin' directly-attached network, a error is returned.
This option can be used ta pin a local host all up in a intercourse
that has no route all up in it provided tha option \fB-I\fR be also
used.
.TP
\fB-R\fR
\fBping\fR only.
Record route.
Includes tha RECORD_ROUTE option up in tha ECHO_REQUEST
packet n' displays tha route buffer on returned packets.
Note dat tha IP header is only big-ass enough fo' nine such routes.
Many hosts ignore or discard dis option.
.TP
\fB-s \fIpacketsize\fB\fR
Specifies tha number of data bytes ta be sent.  
Da default is 56, which translates tha fuck into 64 ICMP
data bytes when combined wit tha 8 bytez of ICMP header data.
.TP
\fB-S \fIsndbuf\fB\fR
Set socket sndbuf. If not specified, it is selected ta buffer
not mo' than one packet.
.TP
\fB-t \fIttl\fB\fR
\fBping\fR only.
Set tha IP Time ta Live.
.TP
\fB-T \fItimestamp option\fB\fR
Set special IP timestamp options.
\fItimestamp option\fR may be either 
\fItsonly\fR (only timestamps), 
\fItsandaddr\fR (timestamps n' addresses) or 
\fItsprespec host1 [host2 [host3 [host4]]]\fR
(timestamp prespecified hops).
.TP
\fB-U\fR
Print full user-to-user latency (the oldschool behaviour). Normally
\fBping\fR
prints network round trip time, which can be different
f.e. cuz of DNS failures. 
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Verbose output.
.TP
\fB-V\fR
Show version n' exit.
.TP
\fB-w \fIdeadline\fB\fR
Specify a timeout, up in seconds, before
\fBping\fR
exits regardless of how tha fuck many
packets done been busted or received. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! In dis case
\fBping\fR
does not stop after
\fIcount\fR
packet is sent, it waits either for
\fIdeadline\fR
expire or until
\fIcount\fR
probes is answered or fo' some error notification from network.   
.TP
\fB-W \fItimeout\fB\fR
Time ta wait fo' a response, up in seconds. Da option affects only timeout
in absence of any responses, otherwise \fBping\fR waits fo' two RTTs.
.PP
When rockin \fBping\fR fo' fault isolation, it should first be run
on tha local host, ta verify dat tha local network intercourse is up
and hustlin. Then, hosts n' gateways further n' further away should be
``pinged''. Round-trip times n' packet loss statistics is computed.
If duplicate packets is received, they is not included up in tha packet
loss calculation, although tha round trip time of these packets is used
in calculatin tha minimum/average/maximum round-trip time numbers.
When tha specified number of packets done been busted (and received) or
if tha program is terminated wit a
SIGINT, a funky-ass brief summary is displayed. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Shorta current statistics
can be obtained without termination of process wit signal
SIGQUIT.
.PP
If \fBping\fR do not receive any reply packets at all it will
exit wit code 1. If a packet 
\fIcount\fR
and
\fIdeadline\fR
are both specified, n' fewer than
\fIcount\fR
packets is received by tha time the
\fIdeadline\fR
has arrived, it will also exit wit code 1. 
On other error it exits wit code 2. Otherwise it exits wit code 0. This
makes it possible ta use tha exit code ta peep if a host is kickin it or
not.
.PP
This program is intended fo' use up in network testing, measurement and
management.
Because of tha load it can impose on tha network, it is unwise ta use
\fBping\fR durin aiiight operations or from automated scripts.
.SH "ICMP PACKET DETAILS"
.PP
An IP header without options is 20 bytes.
An ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packet gotz nuff a additionizzle 8 bytes worth
of ICMP header followed by a arbitrary amount of data.
When a \fIpacketsize\fR is given, dis indicated tha size of this
extra piece of data (the default is 56). Thus tha amount of data received
inside of a IP packet of type ICMP ECHO_REPLY will always be 8 bytes
more than tha axed data space (the ICMP header).
.PP
If tha data space be at least of size of struct timeval
\fBping\fR uses tha beginnin bytez of dis space ta include
a timestamp which it uses up in tha computation of round trip times.
If tha data space is shorter, no round trip times is given.
.SH "DUPLICATE AND DAMAGED PACKETS"
.PP
\fBping\fR will report duplicate n' damaged packets.
Duplicate packets should never occur, n' seem ta be caused by
inappropriate link-level retransmissions.
Duplicates may occur up in nuff thangs n' is rarely (if ever) a
phat sign, although tha presence of low levelz of duplicates may not
always be cause fo' alarm.
.PP
Damaged packets is obviously straight-up cause fo' alarm n' often
indicate fucked up hardware somewhere up in the
\fBping\fR packetz path (in tha network or up in tha hosts).
.SH "TRYING DIFFERENT DATA PATTERNS"
.PP
Da (inter)network layer should never treat packets differently depending
on tha data contained up in tha data portion.
Unfortunately, data-dependent problems done been known ta sneak into
networks n' remain undetected fo' long periodz of time.
In nuff cases tha particular pattern dat gonna git problems is something
that aint gots sufficient ``transitions'', like fuckin all ones or all
zeros, or a pattern right all up in tha edge, like fuckin almost all zeros.
It aint necessarily enough ta specify a thugged-out data pattern of all zeros (for
example) on tha command line cuz tha pattern dat iz of interest is
at tha data link level, n' tha relationshizzle between what tha fuck you type and
what tha controllaz transmit can be fucked up.
.PP
This means dat if you gotz a thugged-out data-dependent problem yo big-ass booty is ghon probably
have ta do a shitload of testin ta find dat shit.
If yo ass is dirty, you may manage ta find a gangbangin' file dat either can't be sent
across yo' network or dat takes much longer ta transfer than other
similar length files.
Yo ass can then examine dis file fo' repeated patterns dat you can test
usin tha \fB-p\fR option of \fBping\fR.
.SH "TTL DETAILS"
.PP
Da TTL value of a IP packet represents tha maximum number of IP routers
that tha packet can go all up in before bein thrown away.
In current practice you can expect each routa up in tha Internizzle ta decrement
the TTL field by exactly one.
.PP
Da TCP/IP justification states dat tha TTL field fo' TCP
packets should be set ta 60 yo, but nuff systems use smalla joints
(4.3 BSD uses 30, 4.2 used 15).
.PP
Da maximum possible value of dis field is 255, n' most Unix systems set
the TTL field of ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packets ta 255.
This is why yo big-ass booty is ghon find you can ``ping'' some hosts yo, but not reach them
with
\fBtelnet\fR(1)
or
\fBftp\fR(1).
.PP
In aiiight operation pin prints tha TTL value from tha packet it receives.
When a remote system receives a pin packet, it can do one of three thangs
with tha TTL field up in its response:
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Not chizzle it; dis is what tha fuck Berkeley Unix systems did before the
4.3BSD Tahoe release. In dis case tha TTL value up in tha received packet
will be 255 minus tha number of routas up in tha round-trip path.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Set it ta 255; dis is what tha fuck current Berkeley Unix systems do.
In dis case tha TTL value up in tha received packet is ghon be 255 minus the
number of routas up in tha path \fBfrom\fR
the remote system \fBto\fR tha \fBping\fRin host.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Set it ta some other value. Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Some machines use tha same value for
ICMP packets dat they use fo' TCP packets, fo' example either 30 or 60.
Others may use straight-up wild joints.
.SH "BUGS"
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Many Hosts n' Gateways ignore tha RECORD_ROUTE option.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Da maximum IP header length is too lil' small-ass fo' options like
RECORD_ROUTE ta be straight-up useful.
Therez not much dat can be done bout this, however.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Flood pingin aint recommended up in general, n' flood pingin the
broadcast address should only be done under straight-up controlled conditions.
