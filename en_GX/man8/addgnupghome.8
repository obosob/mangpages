.SH DESCRIPTION
If GnuPG is installed on a system wit existin user accounts, it is
sometimes required ta populate tha GnuPG home directory wit existing
files.  Especially a \(oq\fItrustlist.txt\fR\(cq n' a keybox wit some
initial certificates is often desired. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  This scripts help ta do this
by copyin all filez from \(oq\fI/etc/skel/.gnupg\fR\(cq ta tha home
directoriez of tha accounts given on tha command line.  It takes care
not ta overwrite existin GnuPG home directories.
