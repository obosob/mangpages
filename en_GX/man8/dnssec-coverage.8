dnssec\-coverage \- checks future DNSKEY coverage fo' a unit

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdnssec\-coverage\fR
verifies dat tha DNSSEC keys fo' a given unit or a set of units have timin metadata set properly ta ensure no future lapses up in DNSSEC coverage.
.PP
If
\fBzone\fR
is specified, then keys found up in tha key repository matchin dat unit is scanned, n' a ordered list is generated of tha events scheduled fo' dat key (i.e., publication, activation, inactivation, deletion). Da list of events is strutted up in order of occurrence. Warnings is generated if any event is scheduled which could cause tha unit ta enta a state up in which validation failures might occur: fo' example, if tha number of published or actizzle keys fo' a given algorithm drops ta zero, or if a key is deleted from tha unit too soon afta a freshly smoked up key is rolled, n' cached data signed by tha prior key has not had time ta expire from resolver caches.
.PP
If
\fBzone\fR
is not specified, then all keys up in tha key repository is ghon be scanned, n' all units fo' which there be keys is ghon be analyzed. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! (Note: This method of reportin is only accurate if all tha units dat have keys up in a given repository share tha same TTL parameters.)
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-f \fIfile\fR
.RS 4
If a
\fBfile\fR
is specified, then tha unit is read from dat file; tha phattest TTL n' tha DNSKEY TTL is determined directly from tha unit data, n' the
\fB\-m\fR
and
\fB\-d\fR
options do not need ta be specified on tha command line.
.RE
.PP
\-K \fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Sets tha directory up in which keys can be found. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Defaults ta tha current hustlin directory.
.RE
.PP
\-m \fImaximum TTL\fR
.RS 4
Sets tha value ta be used as tha maximum TTL fo' tha unit or units bein analyzed when determinin whether there be a possibilitizzle of validation failure. When a unit\-signin key is deactivated, there must be enough time fo' tha record up in tha unit wit tha longest TTL ta have expired from resolver caches before dat key can be purged from tha DNSKEY RRset. If dat condizzle do not apply, a warnin is ghon be generated.
.sp
Da length of tha TTL can be set up in seconds, or up in larger unitz of time by addin a suffix: 'mi' fo' minutes, 'h' fo' hours, 'd' fo' days, 'w' fo' weeks, 'mo' fo' months, 'y' fo' years.
.sp
This option is mandatory unless the
\fB\-f\fR
has been used ta specify a unit file. (If
\fB\-f\fR
has been specified, dis option may still be used; it will overrde tha value found up in tha file.)
.RE
.PP
\-d \fIDNSKEY TTL\fR
.RS 4
Sets tha value ta be used as tha DNSKEY TTL fo' tha unit or units bein analyzed when determinin whether there be a possibilitizzle of validation failure. When a key is rolled (that is, replaced wit a freshly smoked up key), there must be enough time fo' tha oldschool DNSKEY RRset ta have expired from resolver caches before tha freshly smoked up key be activated n' begins generatin signatures. If dat condizzle do not apply, a warnin is ghon be generated.
.sp
Da length of tha TTL can be set up in seconds, or up in larger unitz of time by addin a suffix: 'mi' fo' minutes, 'h' fo' hours, 'd' fo' days, 'w' fo' weeks, 'mo' fo' months, 'y' fo' years.
.sp
This option is mandatory unless the
\fB\-f\fR
has been used ta specify a unit file, or a thugged-out default key TTL was set wit the
\fB\-L\fR
to
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fR. (If either of dem is true, dis option may still be used; it will overrde tha value found up in tha unit or key file.)
.RE
.PP
\-r \fIresign interval\fR
.RS 4
Sets tha value ta be used as tha resign interval fo' tha unit or units bein analyzed when determinin whether there be a possibilitizzle of validation failure. This value defaults ta 22.5 days, which be also tha default in
\fBnamed\fR. But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat if it has been chizzled by the
\fBsig\-validity\-interval\fR
option in
\fInamed.conf\fR, then it should also be chizzled here.
.sp
Da length of tha interval can be set up in seconds, or up in larger unitz of time by addin a suffix: 'mi' fo' minutes, 'h' fo' hours, 'd' fo' days, 'w' fo' weeks, 'mo' fo' months, 'y' fo' years.
.RE
.PP
\-c \fIcompilezone path\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a path ta a
\fBnamed\-compilezone\fR
binary. Used fo' testing.
