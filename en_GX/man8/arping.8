.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBarping\fR [\fB-AbDfhqUV\fR] [\fB-c \fIcount\fB\fR] [\fB-w \fIdeadline\fB\fR] [\fB-s \fIsource\fB\fR] \fB-I \fIinterface\fB\fR \fB\fIdestination\fB\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Pin \fIdestination\fR on thang \fIinterface\fR by ARP packets,
usin source address \fIsource\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-A\fR
Da same as \fB-U\fR yo, but ARP REPLY packets used instead
of ARP REQUEST.
.TP
\fB-b\fR
Send only MAC level broadcasts, n' you can put dat on yo' toast. Normally \fBarping\fR starts
from bustin  broadcast, n' switch ta unicast afta reply received.
.TP
\fB-c \fIcount\fB\fR
Quit afta bustin  \fIcount\fR ARP REQUEST
packets, n' you can put dat on yo' toast. With 
\fIdeadline\fR
option, instead wait for
\fIcount\fR ARP REPLY packets, or until tha timeout expires.
.TP
\fB-D\fR
Duplicate address detection mode (DAD). Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. See 
RFC2131, 4.4.1.
Returns 0, if DAD succeeded i.e. no replies is received
.TP
\fB-f\fR
Finish afta tha straight-up original gangsta reply confirmin dat target is kickin it.
.TP
\fB-I \fIinterface\fB\fR

.TP
\fB-h\fR
Print help page n' exit.
.TP
\fB-q\fR
Quiet output. Nothang is displayed.
.TP
\fB-s \fIsource\fB\fR
IP source address ta use up in ARP packets.
If dis option be absent, source address is:
.RS
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
In DAD mode (with option \fB-D\fR) set ta 0.0.0.0.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
In Unsolicited ARP mode (with options \fB-U\fR or \fB-A\fR)
set ta \fIdestination\fR.
.TP 0.2i
\(bu
Otherwise, it is calculated from routin tables.
.RE
.TP
\fB-U\fR
Unsolicited ARP mode ta update neighbours' ARP caches.
No replies is expected.
.TP
\fB-V\fR

Specify a timeout, up in seconds, before
\fBarping\fR
exits regardless of how tha fuck many
packets done been busted or received. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! In dis case
\fBarping\fR
does not stop after
\fIcount\fR
packet is sent, it waits either for
\fIdeadline\fR
expire or until
\fIcount\fR
probes is answered.

because it allows user ta modify ARP cachez of neighbour hosts.
