.SH NAME
wpa_priv \- wpa_supplicant privilege separation helper
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBwpa_priv\fR [ \fB-c \fIctrl path\fB\fR ]  [ \fB-Bdd\fR ]  [ \fB-P \fIpid file\fB\fR ]  [ \fBdriver:ifname \fI[driver:ifname ...]\fB\fR ] 
.SH "OVERVIEW"
.PP
\fBwpa_priv\fR be a privilege separation helper that
minimizes tha size of \fBwpa_supplicant\fR code dat needs
to be run wit root privileges.
.PP
If enabled, privileged operations is done up in tha wpa_priv process
while leavin rest of tha code (e.g., EAP authentication n' WPA
handshakes) ta operate up in a unprivileged process (wpa_supplicant) that
can be run as non-root user n' shit. Privilege separation restricts tha effects
of potential software errors by containin tha majoritizzle of tha code up in an
unprivileged process ta avoid tha possibilitizzle of a gangbangin' full system
compromise.
.PP
\fBwpa_priv\fR need ta be run wit network admin
privileges (usually, root user). Well shiiiit, it opens a UNIX domain socket fo' each
interface dat is included on tha command line; any other intercourse will
be off limits fo' \fBwpa_supplicant\fR up in dis kind of
configuration. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch fo' realz. Afta this, \fBwpa_supplicant\fR can be run as
a non-root user (e.g., all standard playas on a laptop or as a special
non-privileged user account pimped just fo' dis purpose ta limit access
to user filez even further).
.SH "EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION"
.PP
Da followin steps is a example of how tha fuck ta configure
\fBwpa_priv\fR ta allow playas up in the
\fBwpapriv\fR crew ta rap with
\fBwpa_supplicant\fR wit privilege separation:
.PP
Smoke user crew (e.g., wpapriv) n' assign playas that
should be able ta use wpa_supplicant tha fuck into dat group.
.PP
Smoke /var/run/wpa_priv directory fo' UNIX domain sockets and
control user access by settin it accessible only fo' tha wpapriv
group:
.sp
.RS
.sp
.nf
mkdir /var/run/wpa_priv
chown root:wpapriv /var/run/wpa_priv
chmod 0750 /var/run/wpa_priv
.sp
.fi
.RE
.sp
.PP
Start \fBwpa_priv\fR as root (e.g., from system
startup scripts) wit tha enabled intercourses configured on the
command line:
.sp
.RS
.sp
.nf
wpa_priv -B -c /var/run/wpa_priv -P /var/run/wpa_priv.pid wext:wlan0
.sp
.fi
.RE
.sp
.PP
Run \fBwpa_supplicant\fR as non-root wit a user
that is up in tha wpapriv group:
.sp
.RS
.sp
.nf
wpa_supplicant -i ath0 -c wpa_supplicant.conf
.sp
.fi
.RE
.sp
.SH "COMMAND ARGUMENTS"
.TP
\fB-c ctrl path\fR
Specify tha path ta wpa_priv control directory
(Default: /var/run/wpa_priv/).
.TP
\fB-B\fR
Run as a thugged-out daemon up in tha background.
.TP
\fB-P file\fR
Set tha location of tha PID
file.
.TP
\fBdriver:ifname [driver:ifname ...]\fR
Da <driver> strang dictates which of the
supported \fBwpa_supplicant\fR driver backendz is ta be
used. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! To git a list of supported driver types peep wpa_supplicant help
(e.g, wpa_supplicant -h). Da driver backend supported by most good
drivers is \fBwext\fR\&.

Da <ifname> strang specifies which network
interface is ta be managed by \fBwpa_supplicant\fR
(e.g., wlan0 or ath0).

\fBwpa_priv\fR do not use tha network intercourse
before \fBwpa_supplicant\fR is started, so it is fine to
include network intercourses dat is not available all up in tha time wpa_priv
is started. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time. wpa_priv can control multiple intercourses wit one process,
but it be also possible ta run multiple \fBwpa_priv\fR
processes all up in tha same time, if desired.
