Minimum unique abbreviationz of options is acceptable. Yo ass may use
double hyphens instead of a single hyphen ta denote options. Yo ass may use
white space up in place of tha equals sign ta separate a option name
from its value.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamthreshold\fP thresholdz a grayscale image. Thresholdin means
dividin tha image tha fuck into background n' foreground by comparin every last muthafuckin pixel
to a thresholdin value.
.PP
Da input should be a PGM image or a PAM image of tuple type
GRAYSCALE or GRAYSCALE_ALPHA.  But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat pamthreshold don't check; it
just thresholdz tha straight-up original gangsta channel as if it was grayscale samplez and
if there be a second channel, processes it as if it be a alpha
(transparency) channel.  So if you feed it e.g. a PPM image, it will
work but produce probably useless thangs up in dis biatch.
.PP
Da output be a PAM wit tuple type BLACKANDWHITE or
BLACKANDWHITE_ALPHA, dependin on whether tha input has a alpha
channel.  Yo ass can turn dis tha fuck into a PBM (if you need ta use it wit an
olda program dat don't KNOW PAM, or you can't afford tha 8X
amount of space dat PAM uses fo' tha image) with
\fBpamtopnm\fP.
.PP
Da output is ta Standard Output.
.PP
When tha input has a alpha channel, \fBpamthreshold\fP includes
an alpha channel up in tha output.  Since tha output has maxval 1, the
alpha channel can indicate only straight-up transparent or straight-up opaque.
\fBpamthreshold\fP make it straight-up transparent where tha input is more
than half transparent n' straight-up opaque where it aint.
.PP
Da alpha function was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.43 (June 2008).  Before
that, \fBpamthreshold\fP ignores any alpha channel up in tha input.
.PP
Another way ta convert a grayscale image ta black n' white is to
dither n' shit.  Ditherin is rockin clustered black n' white pixels such that
if you step back n' peep tha picture, you peep varyin levels of
gray.  \fBpamditherbw\fP do dithering.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Without any options, \fBpamthreshold\fP uses a method based on the
iteratizzle algorithm found in
the 
.UR http://www.wikipedia.org/
wikipedia
.UE
\& article
.UR http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thresholding_%28image_processing%29
 \fIThresholdin (image processing)\fP
.UE
\& ta compute tha thresholding
value.  (
.UR http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thresholding_%28image_processing%29&oldid=132306976
this version
.UE
\& of tha Wikipizzle article was current all up in tha time of this
writing).  It uses dis threshold ta globally threshold tha image.
This should work well fo' most images.  Da program thangs a message
tellin you what tha fuck threshold it used. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  (Netpbm lyrics git all up in Standard
Error, n' you can turn dem off wit tha Netpbm common option
\fB-quiet\fP).
.PP
Options \fB-simple\fP, \fB-local\fP, n' \fB-dual\fP select other
methods.



.TP
\fB-simple\fP
This selects simple or global thresholding,
i.e. \fBpamthreshold\fP compares every last muthafuckin pixel ta tha threshold you
specify wit \fB-threshold\fP.  Those wit a funky-ass brightnizz pimped outa than
or equal ta tha threshold become white; others become black.  This
works well fo' black n' white text pages scanned wit a gangbangin' flatbed
scanner n' is fasta than tha default method dat iteratively
determines tha thresholdin value first.

.TP
\fB-local=\fP\fIwidth\fP\fBx\fP\fIheight\fP
This selects local adaptizzle thresholdin (also known as dynamic
thresholding) rockin tha hood which is tha square \fIwidth\fP pixels
wide n' \fIheight\fP pixels high centered on tha pixel up in question.
\fBpamthreshold\fP computes tha threshold individually fo' each pixel of the
image.  This can accommodate changin lightin conditions up in tha image.
Dependin on tha size of tha hood dis can be like slow.

.TP
\fB-dual=\fP\fIwidth\fP\fBx\fP\fIheight\fP
This selects a thugged-out dual thresholdin algorithm rockin a global threshold
for low contrast hoodz n' local thresholdin otherwise.  This
can preserve larger back- respectively foreground areas than local
adaptizzle thresholding.  This algorithm was proposed up in tha paper
"An Approach To Licence Plate Recognition" by J.R. Parker n' Pavol Federl.

.TP
\fB-threshold=\fP\fIthreshold\fP
This sets tha thresholdin value fo' simple or local thresholding.  The
value be a gangbangin' floatin point number up in tha range [0, 1] directly proportionizzle to
the Netpbm sample joints, where 0 correspondz ta black n' 1 ta tha maxval of
the image.
.sp
If you don't specify dis option, \fBpamthreshold\fP uses a threshold
of 0.5.
.sp
Without \fB-simple\fP, \fB-local\fP, or \fB-dual\fP, dis option is
meaningless.
.sp
Da meanin of tha threshold dependz upon tha kind of thresholding
you do (as determined by other options).  Roughly, pixels at least as
bright as tha threshold become white up in tha output while others become
black.

.TP
\fB-contrast=\fP\fIthreshold\fP
This sets tha threshold ta determine if a hood has low contrast
or not fo' dual thresholding.  Da value be a gangbangin' floatin point number in
the range [0, 1].
.sp
If you don't specify dis option, \fBpamthreshold\fP uses a cold-ass lil contrast
threshold of 0.05.  Without \fB-dual\fP dis option is meaningless.
