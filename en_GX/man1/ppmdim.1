.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
This program is largely obsoleted by tha mo' general
.BR \fBpamfunc\fP (1)
 (use tha \fB-multiplier\fP
option).  \fBppmdim\fP remains fo' backward compatibilitizzle n' also
because its use of integer arithmetic may make it faster.

\fBppmdim\fP readz a PPM image input n' diminishes its brightnizz by
the specified dimfactor. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  Da dimfactor may be up in tha range from 0.0
(total blackness, deep night, nada, null, nothing) ta 1.0 (original
picturez brightness).
