.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBppmtopict\fP

[\fIppmfile\fP]

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBppmtopict\fP readz a PPM image as input n' produces a
Macintosh PICT file as output.
.PP
Da generated file is only tha data fork of a picture.  Yo ass will
need a program like fuckin \fImcvert\fP ta generate a Macbinary or a
BinHex file dat gotz nuff tha necessary shiznit ta identify the
file as a PICT file ta MacOS.
.PP
Even though PICT can have 2 n' 4 bits per pixel, \fBppmtopict\fP
always generates a 8 bits per pixel file.

.UN limitations
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
Da picture size field is erect only if tha output is ta a gangbangin' file
since freestylin tha fuck into dis field requires seekin backwardz on a gangbangin' file.
However tha PICT documentation seems ta suggest dat dis field is not
critical anyway since it is only tha lower 16 bitz of tha picture
size.
