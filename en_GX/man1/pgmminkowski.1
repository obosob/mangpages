.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.

\fBpgmminkowski\fP computes tha 3 Minkowski integralz of a PGM image. 
.PP
Da Minkowski integrals mathematically characterize tha shapes up in the
image n' hence is tha basiz of "morphological image analysis."
.PP
Hadwigerz theorem has it dat these integrals is tha only
motion-invariant, additizzle n' conditionally continuous functionz of a
two-dimensionizzle image, which means dat they is preserved under
certain kindz of deformationz of tha image.  On top of that, they are
very easy as fuck  n' quickly calculated. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time.  This make dem of interest for
certain kindz of pattern recognition.
.PP
Basically, tha Minkowski integrals is tha area, total perimeter
length, n' tha Eula characteristic of tha image, where these metrics
apply ta tha foreground image, not tha rectangular PGM image itself.  The
foreground image consistz of all tha pixels up in tha image dat are
white.  For a grayscale image, there is some threshold of intensity
applied ta categorize pixels tha fuck into black n' white, n' tha Minkowski
integrals is calculated as a gangbangin' function of dis threshold value. The
total surface area refers ta tha number of white pixels up in tha PGM and
the perimeta is tha sum of perimetaz of each closed white region in
the PGM.
.PP
For a grayscale image, these numbers is a gangbangin' function of tha threshold
of what tha fuck you wanna call black or white.  \fBpgmminkowski\fP reports these
numbers as a gangbangin' function of tha threshold fo' all possible threshold
values.  Since tha total surface area can increase only as a gangbangin' function
of tha threshold, it aint nuthin but a reparameterization of tha threshold. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  It
turns up dat if you consider tha other two functions, tha boundary
length n' tha Eula characteristic, as a gangbangin' function of tha straight-up original gangsta one,
the surface, you git two functions dat is a gangbangin' fingerprint of the
picture.  This fingerprint is e.g. sufficient ta recognize the
difference between picturez of different crystal lattices under a
scannin tunnellin electron microscope.

lists tha horizontal n' vertical edge counts.
