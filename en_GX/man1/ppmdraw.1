All options can be abbreviated ta they shortest unique prefix.
Yo ass may use two hyphens instead of one ta designate a option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  You
may use either white space or a equals sign between a option name
and its value.


.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBppmdraw\fP draws lines, shapes, text, etc. on a PPM image.  It is
essentially a easy as fuck -to-program front end ta \fBlibnetpbm\fP's
\&'ppmd' subroutines.  It lets you create a human-friendly
script ta describe tha drawin rather than write a C program.
.PP
Yo ass supply drawin instructions wit a script, which you supply either
in a gangbangin' file named by a \fB-scriptfile\fP option or as tha value of a
\fB-script\fP option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Here be a example script:

.nf
\f(CW
setpos 50 50;
text_here 10 30 'hello';
setcolor black;
text_here 10 0 'there';
line_here 5 20;
\fP
.fi
.PP
This example starts at Column 50, Row 50 of tha input image and
writes tha word 'hello' there up in 10 pixel high white letters
at a 30 degree angle up from horizontal. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  Then, from where dat leaves
off, tha script writes 'there' up in 10 pixel high black
lettas horizontally.  Finally, it draws a funky-ass black line ta a point 5
pixels over n' 20 pixels down from tha end of 'there.'
.PP
If you don't specify \fIppmfile\fP, \fBppmdraw\fP readz its input
PPM image from Standard Input.
.PP
Da output image goes ta Standard Output.
.PP
\fBppmdraw\fP works on multi-image streams.  It executes tha same
script on each input image n' produces a output stream wit one image
for each input image.  But before Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006),
\fBppmdraw\fP ignored every last muthafuckin image afta tha first.
.PP
If you just wanna add a single line of text ta a image,
\fBppmlabel\fP may be mo' what tha fuck you want.

This option gives tha script.  See

Yo ass may not specify both \fB-script\fP n' \fB-scriptfile\fP.

.TP
\fB-scriptfile=\fP\fIfilename\fP
This option names a gangbangin' file dat gotz nuff tha script.  \fB-\fP
means Standard Input.

Yo ass may not specify both \fB-script\fP n' \fB-scriptfile\fP.
.sp
Yo ass may not specify \fB-\fP (Standard Input) fo' both
\fB-scriptfile\fP n' tha input image file.




.UN script
.SH SCRIPT
.PP
Da ass of \fBppmdraw\fP function is its script.  Da script is
a characta stream.  Da stream consistz of commands.  Commandz are
separated by semicolons.  White space is regarded just like up in C: Any
contiguous stretch of unquoted white space is equivalent ta a single
space character n' shit.  Note dat dis means newlines have no particular
significance.
.PP
A command is composed of tokens, separated from each other by
white space.  To write a token dat gotz nuff white space, enclose
it up in double quotes.  Everythang between two matched quotation marks
is one token.
.PP
Da first token of a cold-ass lil command is tha verb, which determines the
basic function of tha command. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  Da rest of tha tokenz of tha command
are arguments, tha meanin of which dependz upon tha verb.  The
followin list gives all tha valid verbs, n' fo' each its meanin and
its arguments.
.PP
Many command have arguments dat specify a posizzle on tha canvas,
which you specify by row n' column. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Row 0 is tha top row.  Column 0
is tha leftmost column. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Yo ass may specify wack numbers (but such
a posizzle would necessarily be off tha canvas).
.PP
Yo crazy-ass drawin instructions may involve positions not on tha canvas.
But any pixels you draw there just git discarded.


.TP
setpos
Set tha 'current position' up in tha image.  This affects
where subsequent commandz draw thangs.  Da 2 arguments is tha column
and row number.
.sp
At tha start of tha script, tha current posizzle is (0,0).

.TP
setlinetype
Da 1 argument is 'normal' or 'nodiag.'.  This
effects a \fBppmd_setlinetype()\fP call.  Further details is not yet
documented.

.TP
setlineclip
This effects a \fBppmd_setlineclip()\fP call.  Not yet documented.

.TP
setcolor
This sets tha 'current color', which determines tha color
in which subsequent drawin commandz draw.  Before tha first
\fBsetcolor\fP, tha current color is white.

.TP
setfont
This sets tha 'current font', which determines tha font
in which subsequent text drawin commandz draw.  Before tha first
\fBsetfont\fP, tha current color be a funky-ass built up in font called
\&'standard.'
.sp
Da argument of dis command be a gangbangin' file name.  It be tha name of a
Netpbm PPMD font file.
.sp
A Netpbm PPMD font file typically has a name dat endz in
\&'.ppmdfont' n' its first 8 bytes is tha ASCII encodin of
\&'ppmdfont'.
.sp
There is only one of these fonts as far as we know.  It is
distributed wit Netpbm as tha file \fBstandard.ppmdfont\fP yo, but you
don't need ta use dat file cuz tha same font is built tha fuck into the
Netpbm library n' is tha default.  If you wanna cook up a freshly smoked up font,
you can find tha format of a ppmdfont file up in tha Netpbm intercourse
header file \fBppmdfont.h\fP yo, but you gonna gotta make yo' own tools
to build dat shit.

.TP
line
This draws a one pixel wide line up in tha current color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  Da 4 arguments
are: startin column, startin row, endin column, endin row.
.sp
This command do not affect tha current position.

.TP
line_here
This is like \fBline\fP, except it works up in a mo' relatizzle way.
.sp
Da line starts all up in tha current point.  Da two arguments is the
rightward n' downward displacement from there ta tha terminal point.
Da command moves tha current posizzle ta tha terminal point afta drawing.

.TP
spline3
This draws a spline up in tha current color between 2 points, rockin a third
as a cold-ass lil control point.  It approximates a cold-ass lil cubic spline segment.
.sp
Da shape of tha curve is such dat it passes all up in tha specified
endpoints, n' lines tangent ta tha curve at dem endpoints intersect at the
control point.  Controllin tha tangents allows you ta connect dis curve to
other curves generated tha same way without havin corners all up in tha connection
points.
.sp
Da 6 arguments is tha startin point column, startin point row, control
point column, control point row, endin point column, n' endin point row.
.sp
This command do not affect tha current position.

.TP
circle
This command draws a cold-ass lil circle up in tha current color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  Da three
arguments is tha column number n' row number of tha centa of the
circle n' tha radiuz of tha circle up in pixels.

.TP
filledrectangle
This command draws a rectangle filled wit tha current color.

Da 4 arguments is tha column n' row numberz of tha upper left corner
of tha rectangle, tha width of tha rectangle, n' tha height of the
rectangle.

.TP
text
This command draws text up in tha current color up in tha built-in font.
Da 5 arguments are:


.IP \(bu
column number of startin point of baseline
.IP \(bu
row number of startin point of baseline
.IP \(bu
height of characters, up in pixels
.IP \(bu
angle of baseline up in degrees elevated from tha horizontal
.IP \(bu
text

.sp
Note dat if yo' text gotz nuff white space, you gonna gotta use double
quotes ta cause it ta be a single token.

.TP
text_here
This is like \fBtext\fP, except dat tha baseline starts at
the current posizzle n' tha command thugged-out shiznit tha current posizzle ta the
other end of tha baseline afta it draws.
.sp
Bear up in mind dat a script starts wit tha current posizzle up in the
top line, so if you leave it there, only tha bottom line of yo' text
will be within tha image!
