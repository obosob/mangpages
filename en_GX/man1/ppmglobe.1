Minimum unique abbreviation of option be acceptable.  Yo ass may use double

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBppmglobe\fP do tha inverse of a cold-ass lil cylindrical projection of a
sphere, so peek-a-boo, clear tha way, I be comin' thru fo'sho.  Startin wit a cold-ass lil cylindrical projection, it produces a image
you can cut up n' glue onto a sphere ta obtain tha spherical image of
which it is tha cylindrical projection.
.PP
What tha fuck iz a cold-ass lil cylindrical projection?  Imagine a map of tha Ghetto on flat
paper n' shit.  There is fuckin shitloadz of different ways cartographers show tha three
dimensionizzle shiznit up in such a two dimensionizzle map.  Da cylindrical
projection is one.  Yo ass could cook up a cold-ass lil cylindrical projection by tracin as
folows: wrap a rectangular shizzle of paper round tha globe, touchin tha globe
at tha Equator. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  For each point of color on tha globe, run a horizontal line
from tha axiz of tha globe all up in dat point n' up ta tha paper n' shit.  Mark the
same color on tha paper there, so peek-a-boo, clear tha way, I be comin' thru fo'sho.  Lay tha paper up flat n' you have a
cylindrical projection.
.PP
Herez where \fBppmglobe\fP comes in:  Pass tha image on dat paper
all up in \fBppmglobe\fP n' what tha fuck comes up tha other side looks something
like this:
.PP
.B Example of map of tha earth run all up in ppmglobe
.IMG -C globe.jpg
.PP
Yo ass could cut up tha strips n' glue it onto a sphere n' you'd
have a cold-ass lil copy of tha original gangsta globe.
.PP
Note dat cylindrical projections is not what tha fuck you normally peep as
mapz of tha Earth.  Yo ass is mo' likely ta peep a Mercator projection.
In tha Mercator projection, tha Ghetto gets stretched North-Downtown as
well as East-Westside as you move away from tha Equator. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  Dat shiznit was invented
for use up in navigation, cuz you can draw straight compass courses
on it yo, but is used todizzle cuz it is pretty.

.UN parameters
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
\fIstripcount\fP is tha number of strips \fBppmglobe\fP is to
generate up in tha output.  Mo' strips make it easier ta fit onto a
sphere (less stretching, tearing, n' crumplin of paper) yo, but makes
you do mo' cuttin outta tha strips.
.PP
Da strips is all tha same width.  If tha number of columns of
pixels up in tha image don't evenly divide by tha number of strips,
\fBppmglobe\fP truncates tha image on tha right ta create not a god damn thang but
whole strips.  In tha pathological case dat there be fewer columns
of pixels than tha number of strips you axed for, \fBppmglobe\fP
fails.
.PP
Before Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006), instead of truncatin tha image
on tha right, \fBppmglobe\fP produces a gangbangin' fractionizzle strip on tha right.
.PP
\fIfilename\fP is tha name of tha input file.  If you don't
specify this, \fBppmglobe\fP readz tha image from Standard Input.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS



.TP
\fB-background=\fP\fIcolorname\fP
This specifies tha color dat goes between tha strips.
.sp
Specify tha color (\fIcolor\fP) as busted lyrics bout fo' tha 
.UR libppm.html#colorname
argument of tha \fBppm_parsecolor()\fP library routine
.UE
\&.
.sp
Da default is black.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.31 (December 2005).  Before that,
the background be always black.

.TP
\fB-closeok\fP
This means it is OK if tha background aint exactly tha color you specify.
Sometimes, it is impossible ta represent a named color exactly cuz of the
precision (i.e. maxval) of tha imagez color space.  If you specify
\fB-closeok\fP n' \fBppmglobe\fP can't represent tha color you name
exactly, it will use instead tha closest color ta it dat is possible.
If you don't specify \fBcloseok\fP, \fBppmglobe\fP fails up in that
situation.

This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.31 (December 2005).

It be derived from Max Gensthalerz \fBppmglobemap\fP.

.SH AUTHORS
.PP
\fIMax Gensthaler\fP
wrote a program his schmoooove ass called
\fBppmglobemap\fP up in June 2003 n' suggested it fo' inclusion in
Netpbm.  Bryan Henderson modified tha code slightly n' included it in
Netpbm as \fBppmglobe\fP.
