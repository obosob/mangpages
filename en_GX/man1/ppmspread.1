This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBppmspread\fP readz a PPM image as input n' moves every last muthafuckin pixel
around a random bit relatizzle ta its original gangsta position. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. \fIamount\fP
determines by how tha fuck nuff pixels a pixel is ta be moved round at most.
.PP
Pictures processed wit dis filta will seem ta be somewhat
dissolved or unfocussed (although they step tha fuck up mo' coarse than images
processed by suttin' like \fIpnmconvol\fP).
.PP
Da randomnizz up in tha image is limited before Netpbm 10.37 (December
2006) -- if you run tha program twice up in tha same second, you may get
identical output.
