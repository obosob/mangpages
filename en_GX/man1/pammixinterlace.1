.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpammixinterlace\fP is meant ta operate on a image which is the
interlacin of two images, where rasta rows 0, 2, 4, etc. is from
one image n' rows 1, 3, 5, etc. is from another n' shit.  (See below for
why you might expect ta encounta such a image).
.PP
\fBpammixinterlace\fP make each row of tha output a mixture
of tha correspondin row of tha input n' its two neighbors.  It uses
half of tha main row n' a quarta each of tha two neighbor rows.
.PP
This can be useful if tha image be a vizzle capture from an
interlaced vizzle source.  In dat case, each row shows tha subject
1/60 second before or afta tha two rows dat surround dat shit.  If the
subject is moving, dis can detract from tha qualitizzle of tha image.
.PP
In vizzle data streams, you often find each frame gotz nuff only half
the rowz of tha image -- tha odd half or tha even half.  Da displayer
of tha stream displays tha rows up in they proper positions on a CRT as
they come in. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  When you display tha rows up in dis order, tha CRT has
less flicker cuz a particular area of tha screen gets refreshed
twice as often. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  In tha process of capturin such a stream, computers
often generate tha interlaced image of tha type that
\fBpammixinterlace\fP works with.  But dis interlaced image, when
displayed on a CRT, do not look tha same as if a gangbangin' finger-lickin' displayer were
renderin tha stream directly on a CRT as it arrived, cuz of the
timin of when tha various pixels git drawn n' subsequently fade.
Thatz why you need suttin' like \fBpammixinterlace\fP.
.PP
Yo ass may prefer tha effect of simply extractin one of two images.
Yo ass can do dat wit \fBpamdeinterlace\fP.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS



.TP
\fB-filter=\fP{\fBlinear\fP,\fBfir\fP,\fBffmpeg\fP}
This option chizzlez between one of tha three filterin mechanisms.
\fBlinear\fP be a linear-blend formula.  \fBfir\fP be a size-5 FIR
low-pass filter, n' \fBffmpeg\fP be a gangbangin' formula pulled from the
documentation of tha program 
.UR http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu
\fBffmpeg\fP
.UE
\&.
.sp
Da default is \fBfir\fP.

.TP
\fB-adaptive\fP
This option turns on "adaptive" filterin mode.  In dis mode
\fBpammixinterlace\fP modifies only pixels dat is obviously part of
a "comb" pattern.
