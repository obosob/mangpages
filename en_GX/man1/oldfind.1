.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B oldfind
and
.B find
programs is functionally identical. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  Da only difference between them
is tha implementation internalz of how tha fuck tha filesystem is searched.
The
.B oldfind
binary has a recursive implementation while
.B find
uses
.BR fts (3).
Da fts-based implementation will replace tha recursive implementation
but fo' tha moment both implementations is installed.
.P
Da implementation which is installed as
.B find
on dis system is tha fts-based implementation, since the
.B \-\-without\-fts
option was not passed ta the
.B configure
script when findutils was built.
