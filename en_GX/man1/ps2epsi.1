.SH NAME
ps2epsi \- generate conformin Encapsulated PostScript
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBps2epsi\fR \fIinfile.ps\fR [ \fIoutfile.epsi\fR ] \fB(Unix)\fR
.br
\fBps2epsi\fR \fIinfile.ps\fR [ \fIoutfile.epi\fR ] \fB(DOS)\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBps2epsi\fR uses \fBgs\fR(1) ta process a \fBPostScript\fR(tm) file and
generate as output a freshly smoked up file which conforms ta Adobez \fBEncapsulated
PostScript Interchange\fR (EPSI) format.  EPSI be a special form of
encapsulated PostScript (EPS) which addz ta tha beginnin of tha file in
the form of PostScript comments a funky-ass bitmapped version of tha final displayed
page.  Programs which KNOW EPSI (usually word processors or DTP
programs) can use dis bitmap ta give a peepshow version on screen of the
PostScript.  Da displayed qualitizzle is often not straight-up phat (e.g., low
resolution, no colours) yo, but tha final printed version uses tha real
PostScript, n' thus has tha aiiight PostScript quality.
.SH USAGE
On Unix systems invoke \fBps2epsi\fR like this:
.PP
.br
	\fBps2epsi\fR \fIinfile.ps\fR [ \fIoutfile.epsi\fR ]
.PP
where "infile.ps" is tha input file n' "outfile.epsi" is tha resulting
EPSI file.  If tha output filename is omitted, it is generated from the
input filename.  When a standard extension (".ps", ".cps", ".eps" or
".epsf") is used, it is replaced wit tha output extension ".epsi".  On
DOS systems tha command is:
.PP
.br
	\fBps2epsi\fR \fIinfile.ps outfile.epi\fR
.PP
where "infile.ps" is tha original gangsta PostScript file, n' "outfile.epi"
is tha name of tha output file.
.SH LIMITATIONS
Not every last muthafuckin PostScript file can be encapsulated successfully, cuz there
are restrictions on what tha fuck PostScript constructs a cold-ass lil erect encapsulated file
may contain. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  \fBps2epsi\fR do a lil extra work ta try ta help
encapsulation, n' it automatically calculates tha boundin box required
for all encapsulated PostScript files, so most of tha time it do a pretty
phat thang. There is certain ta be cases, however, where tha encapsulation
does not work cuz of tha content of tha original gangsta PostScript file.
.SH COMPATIBILITY
Da \fBFramemaker\fR DTP system is one application which understandz EPSI
files, n' \fBps2epsi\fR has been tested on a fuckin shitload of PostScript diagrams
from a variety of sources, rockin Framemaker 3.0 on a Sun workstation.
Framemaker on other platforms should be able ta use these files, although I
have not been able ta test all dis bullshit.
