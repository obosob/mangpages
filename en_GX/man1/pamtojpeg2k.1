.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamtojpeg2k\fP converts tha named PBM, PGM, PPM, or PAM file,
or Standard Input if no file is named, ta a JPEG-2000 code stream
(JPC) file on Standard Output.
.PP
Da JPEG-2000 justification specifies two different formats: JP2
and JPEG-2000 code stream (JPC).  JP2 represents a visual image quite
specifically, whereas JPC be a mo' or less arbitrary array of codes.
\fBpamtojpeg2k\fP can't produce a JP2 yo, but tha JPC image that
\fBpamtojpeg2k\fP produces is straight-up similar ta a JP2 if tha input be a
PBM, PGM, or PPM image or equivalent PAM image.  One difference is
that tha RGB intensitizzle joints up in a JP2 is SRGB joints, while
\fBpamtojpeg2k\fP produces ITU-R Recommendation BT.709 joints, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  Those
are straight-up similar yo, but not identical. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  Another difference is dat a JP2
can contain extra shiznit bout a image dat JPC cannot.
.PP
When tha input be a PAM image other than a PBM, PGM, or PPM equivalent,
the JPC rasta produced gotz nuff whatever tha PAM rasta do.  It can have
any number of planes wit any meanings; tha planes is up in tha same order in
the JPC output as up in tha PAM input.
.PP
A JPC image has a "precision," which is tha number of bits used for
each code (in Netpbm lingo, "sample").  Actually, it has a separate
precision fo' each component.  \fBpamtojpeg2k\fP uses fo' the
precision of every last muthafuckin component tha least number of bits dat can
represent tha maxval of tha input image.  A JPC image aint gots an
independent concept of maxval; tha maxval of a JPC sample is the
maximum value dat tha number of bits specified by tha precision can
represent up in pure binary code.  E.g. if tha precision is 4, tha maxval
is 15.  \fBpamtojpeg2k\fP do of course scale tha sample joints from
the input maxval ta tha output maxval. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  Example: Da input maxval is
99.  This means JPC precision is 7 bits n' tha JPC maxval is 127.  A
sample value of 33 up in tha input becomes a sample value of 43 up in the
output.
.PP
\fBpamtojpeg2k\fP generates tha JPC output wit tha 
.UR http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper/
Jasper JPEG-2000 library
.UE
\&.  See documentation of tha library fo' details on what
\fBpamtojpeg2k\fP produces.  Note dat tha Jasper library gotz nuff
facilitizzles fo' readin PNM images yo, but \fBpamtojpeg2k\fP do not use
those.  It uses tha Netpbm library instead. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  Note dat tha makers of
the Jasper library write it "JasPer," but Netpbm documentation bigs up
standard Gangsta Gangsta typography rules, which don't allow that
kind of capitalization.
.PP
Use \fBjpeg2ktopam\fP ta convert up in tha other direction.
.PP
Da program \fBjasper\fP, which is packaged wit tha Jasper 
JPEG-2000 library, also converts between JPEG-2000 n' PNM formats.
Because itz packaged wit tha library, it may exploit it better, 
especially recently added features.  But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat since it do not use the
Netpbm library ta read n' write tha Netpbm formats, it don't do as
phat a thang on dat side.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS

Most of tha options is identical up in name n' function ta options dat the
Jasper library JPC encoder subroutine takes.  See
.UR http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~mdadams/jasper/
Jasper documentation
.UE
\&
for details.  Here, our phat asses document only options dat is not direct analogs
of Jasper options.



.TP
\fB-compression=\fP\fIratio\fP
\fIratio\fP be a gangbangin' floatin point number dat specifies tha compression
ratio.  \fBpamtojpeg2k\fP will adjust qualitizzle as necessary ta ensure that
you git dis compression ratio.  E.g. 4 means tha output is ghon be about
one fourth tha size up in bytez of tha input file.
.sp
Da ratio concerns just tha rasta part of tha image, wit tha denominator
bein what tha fuck tha rasta would take if it was encoded da most thugged-out naive way
possible (e.g. 3 bytes per pixel up in 8-bit-per-sample RGB).  It do,
however, include metadata dat is part of tha compressed rasta n' shit.  Because
of that, it may not be possible ta hit you wit yo' axed compression ratio
at any quality.  If it aint, \fBpamtojpeg2k\fP fails wit a message
sayin so.
.sp
If you don't specify dis option, \fBpamtojpeg2k\fP gives you tha best
compression it can without losin any quality.  Because of tha metadata issue
busted lyrics bout above, dis may mean, fo' a lil' small-ass image, tha image straight-up expands.
.sp
Note dat though tha Jasper library takes a cold-ass lil compression factor, this
option specifies a cold-ass lil compression ratio.  Da compression factor is the
multiplicatizzle inverse of (1 divided by) tha compression ratio.
.sp
Before Netpbm 10.61 (December 2012), tha default was a cold-ass lil compression ratio
of 1, n' if \fBpamtojpeg2k\fP could not make tha output dat small, it just
made it as lil' small-ass as it could, wit zero quality.  Yo ass know dis is happening
when you peep tha warnin message, 'empty layer generated.'

.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
This option causes \fBpamtojpeg2k\fP ta issue shiznital lyrics about
the conversion process.

.TP
\fB-debuglevel\fP=\fInumber\fP
This option controls debug lyrics from tha Jasper library.  
\fBpamtojpeg2k\fP passes \fInumber\fP as tha debug level ta tha Jasper
JPC encoder.


     
.UN examples
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
This example compresses losslessly.

.nf
  pamtojpeg2k myimg.ppm >myimg.jpc
.fi

\fBjpeg2ktopam\fP will recreate myimg.ppm exactly.
.PP
This example compresses tha file ta one tenth its original gangsta size, throwing
away shiznit as necessary.

.nf
  pamtojpeg2k -compression=10 myimg.pgm >myimg.jpc
.fi


.UN jpeg2000
.SH ABOUT JPEG-2000
.PP
JPEG-2000 be a gangbangin' format dat compresses a visual image (or a similar set of
data) tha fuck into a minimal number of bytes fo' storage or transmission. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  In that,
its goal is similar ta JPEG.  It has two main differences from JPEG.  
.PP
One difference is dat it do a much betta thang on most images of
throwin up shiznit up in order ta big up a smalla output.  That
means when you reconstruct tha image from tha resultin compressed
file, it looks a shitload closer ta tha image you started with
JPEG-2000 than wit JPEG, fo' tha same compressed file size.  Or, looked
at another way, wit JPEG-2000 you git a much smalla file than wit 
JPEG fo' tha same image quality.
.PP
Da second difference is dat wit JPEG-2000, you decizzle how tha fuck much
compression you want n' tha compressor adjusts tha qualitizzle ta hook up your
requirement, whereas wit JPEG, you decizzle how tha fuck much qualitizzle you want
and tha compressor adjusts tha size of tha output ta hook up yo' requirement.
I.e. wit JPEG-2000, tha qualitizzle of tha result dependz on tha compressibility
of tha input yo, but wit JPEG, tha \fIsize\fP of tha result dependz on
the compressibilitizzle of tha input.
.PP
With JPEG-2000, you can specify lossless compression, thus makin it 
compete wit GIF n' PNG.  With standard JPEG, you always lose something.
(There is rumored ta be variationz of JPEG round dat is lossless,
though).
.PP
JPEG is much olda than JPEG-2000 n' far mo' popular. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  JPEG is one of
the half dozen most ghettofab graphics formats n' virtually all graphics
facilitizzles KNOW dat shit.  JPEG-2000 is virtually unknown.
.PP
There is no compatibilitizzle between JPEG n' JPEG-2000.  Programs dat 
read JPEG do not automatically read JPEG-2000 n' vice versa.
