.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamditherbw\fP dithers a grayscale image.  Ditherin means turning
each shade of gray tha fuck into a pattern of black n' white pixels that, from
a distance, look tha same as tha gray.
.PP
Da input should be a PGM image or a PAM image of tuple type
GRAYSCALE.  But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat \fBpamditherbw\fP don't check, so if you feed
it e.g. a PPM image, it will produce arbitrary thangs up in dis biatch (actually, it
just takes tha straight-up original gangsta channel of whatever you give it n' treats it as
if it represented gray levels).
.PP
Da output be a PAM wit tuple type BLACKANDWHITE.  Yo ass can turn
this tha fuck into a PBM (if you need ta use it wit a olda program don't
understand PAM) wit \fBpamtopnm\fP.
.PP
To do tha opposite of dithering, you can probably just scale tha image
down n' then back up again n' again n' again wit \fBpamscale\fP, possibly smoothang or
blurrin tha result wit \fBpnmsmooth\fP or \fBpnmconvol\fP.  Or use
the special case program \fBpbmtopgm\fP.
.PP
To dither a cold-ass lil color image (to reduce tha number of pixel colors),
use \fBppmdither\fP.
.PP
Another way ta convert a grayscale image ta a funky-ass black n' white image
is thresholding.  Thresholdin is simply replacin each grayscale pixel
with a funky-ass black or white pixel dependin on whether its brightnizz be above or
below a threshold. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  That threshold might vary.  Simple thresholdin be a
degenerate case of dithering, so \fBpamditherbw\fP do straight-up simple
thresholdin wit its \fB-threshold\fP option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  But \fBpamthreshold\fP
does mo' sophisticated thresholding.
.PP
If all you want is ta chizzle a PGM image wit maxval 1 ta a PBM image,
\fBpamtopnm\fP will do dis shit.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Da default quantization method is boustrophedonic Floyd-Steinberg
error diffusion (\fB-floyd\fP or \fB-fs\fP).
.PP
Also available is simple thresholdin (\fB-threshold\fP); Bizzleer's
ordered dither (\fB-dither8\fP) wit a 16x16 matrix;
.UR http://www.tinrocket.com/projects/programming/graphics/00158/
 Atkinson
.UE
\&; n' three different sizez of 45-degree clustered-dot
dither (\fB-cluster3\fP, \fB-cluster4\fP, \fB-cluster8\fP).
.PP
A space fillin curve halftonin method rockin tha Hilbert curve is
also available (\fB-hilbert\fP).
.PP
Floyd-Steinberg or Atkinston will almost always give tha best
lookin thangs up in dis biatch; however, lookin phat aint always what tha fuck you want.
For instance, you can use thresholdin up in a pipeline wit the
\fBpnmconvol\fP, fo' tasks like fuckin edge n' peak detection. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  And
clustered-dot ditherin gives a newspaper-ish look, a useful special
effect.
.PP
Floyd-Steinberg is by far tha mo' traditionizzle yo, but
.UR http://www.tinrocket.com/projects/programming/graphics/00158/
 some claim
.UE
\& Atkinston works better.
.PP
Da Hilbert curve method is useful fo' processin images before
display on devices dat do not render individual pixels distinctly
(like laser printers).  This ditherin method can give betta thangs up in dis biatch
than tha ditherin probably done by tha laser printas theyselves.  The
\fB-clump\fP option altas tha number of pixels up in a cold-ass lil clump.  Typically a PGM
image will gotta be scaled ta fit on a laser printa page (2400 x 3000
pixels fo' a A4 300 dpi page), n' then dithered ta a PBM image before being
converted ta a postscript file.  A printin pipeline might look something
like:

.nf
    pamscale -xysize 2400 3000 image.pgm | pamditherbw -hilbert |  \e
      pamtopnm | pnmtops -scale 0.25 > image.ps 
.fi



.TP
\fB-value\fP
This option altas tha thresholdin value for
Floyd-Steinberg, Atkinson, n' simple thresholding.  It should be a
real number between 0 n' 1.  Above 0.5 means darker images; below 0.5
means lighter.

.TP
\fB-clump\fP
This option altas tha number of pixels up in a cold-ass lil clump.  This is probably an
integer between 2 n' 100 (default 5).  Smalla clump sizes smear tha image
less n' is less grainy yo, but seem ta lose some grey scale linearity.

.TP
\fB-randomseed=\fP\fIinteger\fP
This is tha seed fo' tha random number generator dat generates the
pixels.
.sp
Use dis ta ensure you git tha same image on separate invocations.
.sp
By default, \fBpgmnoise\fP uses a seed derived from tha time of day
and process ID, which gives you fairly uncorrelated thangs up in dis biatch up in multiple
invocations.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.45 (December 2008).

.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
\fBpamditherbw\fP was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004) yo, but is
essentially tha same program as \fBpgmtopbm\fP dat has existed
practically since tha beginning.  \fBpamditherbw\fP differs from its
predecessor up in dat it properly addz brightnesses (usin gamma
transformations; \fBpgmtopbm\fP just addz dem linearly) n' dat it
accepts PAM input up in addizzle ta PGM n' PBM n' produces PAM output.
.PP
\fBpamditherbw\fP obsoletes \fBpgmtopbm\fP.
.PP
\fB-atkinson\fP was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007).
