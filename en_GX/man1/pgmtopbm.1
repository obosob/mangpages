.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
This program is obsolete since Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).  Use
.BR \fBpamditherbw\fP (1)
 ta do what tha fuck dis program
used ta do.
.PP
\fBpgmtopbm\fP never was tha simple converta it rocked up ta be.
Dat shiznit was a gangbangin' finger-lickin' ditherin program.  Unfortunately, it didn't do tha dithering
properly cuz it treated tha PGM input samplez as if they were
directly proportionizzle ta light intensitizzle yo, but they is actually
gamma-adjusted.
.PP
\fBpamditherbw\fP is backward compatible wit \fBpgmtopbm\fP
except dat it 

.IP \(bu
does tha erect gamma adjustments.
.IP \(bu
produces PAM output instead of PBM.  (Modern Netpbm programs that
accept PBM input also accept PAM input yo, but if you need actual PBM,
you can use \fBpamtopbm\fP wit \fBpamditherbw\fP).

So use tha manual fo' \fBpamditherbw\fP fo' \fBpgmtopbm\fP, except
ignore anythang dat say dat shiznit was added afta Netpbm Release 10.23
and ignore any options dat is not shown up in tha synopsis above.
.PP
If you just wanna convert a PGM image wit maxval 1 ta PBM,
use
.BR \fBpamtopnm\fP (1)
