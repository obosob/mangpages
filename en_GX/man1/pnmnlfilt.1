.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpnmnlfilt\fP produces a output image where tha pixels is a
summary of multiple pixels near tha correspondin location up in a input
image.
.PP
This program works on multi-image streams.
.PP
This is suttin' of a swiss army knife filter n' shit.  It has 3 distinct
operatin modes.  In all of tha modes \fBpnmnlfilt\fP examines each
pixel up in tha image n' processes it accordin ta tha jointz of it and
its surroundin pixels.  Rather than rockin a square block of
surroundin pixels (e.g. tha subject pixel n' its 8 immediate
neighbors, up in a 3x3 square), \fBpnmnlfilt\fP uses 7 hexagonal areas.
Yo ass chizzle tha size of tha hexagons wit tha radius parameter n' shit.  A
radius value of 1/3 means dat tha 7 hexagons essentially fit tha fuck into the
subject pixel (ie.  there is ghon be no filterin effect).  A radius
value of 1.0 means dat tha 7 hexagons essentially cover tha 3x3
immediate neighbor square.
.PP
Yo crazy-ass chizzle of 'alpha' parameta selects among tha three
modes.

.UN alphatrimmedmean
.SS 
Alpha trimmed mean filta (0.0 <= alpha <= 0.5)
.PP
Da value of tha centa pixel is ghon be replaced by tha mean of
the 7 hexagon joints yo, but tha 7 joints is sorted by size n' tha top
and bottom alpha portion of tha 7 is excluded from tha mean. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  This
implies dat a alpha value of 0.0 gives tha same ol' dirty sort of output as a
normal convolution (ie. averagin or smoothang filter), where radius
will determine tha 'strength' of tha filter n' shiznit fo' realz. A phat value to
start from fo' subtle filterin be alpha = 0.0, radius = 0.55 For a
more blatant effect, try alpha 0.0 n' radius 1.0
.PP
An alpha value of 0.5 will cause tha median value of tha 7 hexagons
to be used ta replace tha centa pixel value. This sort of filta is
phat fo' eliminatin 'pop' or single pixel noise from an
image without spreadin tha noise up or smudgin features on the
image. Judicious use of tha radius parameta will fine tune the
filtering. Intermediate jointz of alpha give effects somewhere between
smoothang n' 'pop' noise reduction. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. For subtle filtering
try startin wit jointz of alpha = 0.4, radius = 0.6 For a more
blatant effect try alpha = 0.5, radius = 1.0

.UN optimalestsmooth
.SS 
Optimal estimation smoothing. (1.0 <= alpha <= 2.0)
.PP
This type of filta applies a smoothang filta adaptively over the
image.  For each pixel tha variizzle of tha surroundin hexagon joints
is calculated, n' tha amount of smoothang is made inversely
proportionizzle ta dat shit. Da scam is dat if tha variizzle is lil' small-ass then it
is cuz of noise up in tha image, while if tha variizzle is large, it is
because of 'wanted' image features fo' realz. As usual tha radius
parameta controls tha effectizzle radius yo, but it probably advisable to
leave tha radius between 0.8 n' 1.0 fo' tha variizzle calculation to
be meaningful naaahhmean?  Da alpha parameta sets tha noise threshold, over
which less smoothang is ghon be done.  This means dat lil' small-ass joints of
alpha will give da most thugged-out subtle filterin effect, while big-ass joints
will tend ta smooth all partz of tha image. Yo ass could start with
values like alpha = 1.2, radius = 1.0 n' try increasin or decreasing
the alpha parameta ta git tha desired effect. This type of filta is
best fo' filterin up ditherin noise up in both bitmap n' color
images.

.UN edgeenhance
.SS Edge enhancement. (-0.1 >= alpha >= -0.9)
.PP
This is tha opposite type of filta ta tha smoothang filter n' shit. It
enhances edges. Da alpha parameta controls tha amount of edge
enhancement, from subtle (-0.1) ta blatant (-0.9). Da radius
parameta controls tha effectizzle radius as usual yo, but useful joints
are between 0.5 n' 0.9. Try startin wit jointz of alpha = 0.3,
radius = 0.8

.UN combination
.SS Combination use.
.PP
Da various modez of \fBpnmnlfilt\fP can be used one afta the
other ta git tha desired result. For instizzle ta turn a monochrome
dithered image tha fuck into a grayscale image you could try one or two passes
of tha smoothang filter, followed by a pass of tha optimal estimation
filter, then some subtle edge enhancement. Note dat rockin edge
enhancement is only likely ta be useful afta one of tha non-linear
filtas (alpha trimmed mean or optimal estimation filter), as edge
enhancement is tha direct opposite of smoothing.
.PP
For reducin color quantization noise up in images (ie. turnin .gif
filez back tha fuck into 24 bit files) you could try a pass of tha optimal
estimation filta (alpha 1.2, radius 1.0), a pass of tha median filter
(alpha 0.5, radius 0.55), n' possibly a pass of tha edge enhancement
filter n' shit.  Several passez of tha optimal estimation filta with
declinin alpha joints is mo' effectizzle than a single pass wit a
pimpin' alpha value.  As usual, there be a tradeoff between filtering
effectivenizz n' losin detail. Experimentation is encouraged.
