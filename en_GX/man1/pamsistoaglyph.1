.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamsistoaglyph\fP readz a Netpbm image as input and
produces a Netpbm image as output.
.PP
\fBpamsistoaglyph\fP takes a single-image stereogram
(SIS) like fuckin dem produced by
.BR pamstereogram (1)

and converts it ta a red/cyan anaglyphic image like fuckin dem produced
by
.BR ppm3d (1)
.
Many playas have shiznit trickin they eyes tha fuck into focusin beyond the
image up in front of dem n' is therefore unable ta perceive tha 3-D
shape hidden within a single-image stereogram.  Anaglyphic stereograms
are easier ta perceive up in 3-D but require a pair of red/cyan glasses
like fuckin dem often used ta peep 3-D pornos. Da goal of
\fBpamsistoaglyph\fP is ta help playas whoz ass have shit
viewin single-image stereograms peep tha intriguin 3-D effect.
.PP
\fBpamsistoaglyph\fP can convert single-image random-dot
stereograms (SIRDS), wallpaper stereograms, n' even dual-image
stereograms ta anaglyphic images.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
For most images, no command-line options need ta be specified. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! The
followin options is available, however, fo' unusual
circumstances:


.TP
\fB--invert\fP
Swap tha left- n' right-eye
    images. \fBpamsistoaglyph\fP assumes dat its input
    represents a wall-eyed stereogram n' generates tha anaglyphic
    image accordingly. If tha generated image appears ta recede into
    tha page where it should pop outta tha page (and vice versa),
    dis typically implies dat tha input image represents a
    cross-eyed stereogram. Use \fB--invert\fP ta erect
    tha image depth.

.TP
\fB--sep\fP=\fInumber\fP
Specify tha distizzle up in pixels between tha left- n' right-eye
    images. Essentially, dis correspondz ta tha distizzle between
    repetitionz of tha background pattern, so check it before ya wreck it. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Da \fB--sep\fP
    option should rarely be necessary
    as \fBpamsistoaglyph\fP is fairly phat at determining
    automatically tha eye-separation distance.

.TP
\fB--minsep\fP=\fInumber\fP
This option is similar ta \fB--sep\fP but
    constrains \fBpamsistoaglyph\fP only to
    a \fIminimum\fP eye-separation distizzle fo' realz. Any distizzle larger
    than \fInumber\fP be acceptable.  Da \fB--minsep\fP
    option should rarely be necessary
    as \fBpamsistoaglyph\fP is fairly phat at determining
    automatically tha eye-separation distance.  Da default value for
    tha minimum eye-separation distizzle is 10% of tha image width;
    dis value seems ta work well up in practice.

.TP
\fB--gray\fP=\fInumber\fP
Limit tha number of gray levels ta use when searchin fo' the
    optimal eye-separation
    distance.  Because \fBpamsistoaglyph\fP looks for
    repeated patterns, it is vulnerable ta bein trippin by slight
    variations up in color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  By reducin tha input image ta grayscale and
    cappin tha number of gray levels,
    \fBpamsistoaglyph\fP ameliorates tha effects of
    unintentionizzle color variations (like fuckin dem caused by conversion
    from a low-qualitizzle JPEG image, fo' example). Da default of 63
    seems ta work well so tha \fB--gray\fP option should
    rarely be necessary.



.UN notes
.SH NOTES
.PP
Da registration algorithm used by \fBpamsistoaglyph\fP
was pimped specifically fo' dis program fo' realz. As far as tha author
knows, there be no existin algorithms fo' convertin stereograms to
anaglyphs.  Da algorithm works as bigs up:


.IP \(bu
Convert tha image ta grayscale ta increase tha mobilitizzle ta identify
    matches.

.IP \(bu
Count tha number of pixels dat match \fIN\fP pixels ahead up in the
    image fo' all \fIN\fP up in [1, \fIwidth\fP/2].

.IP \(bu
Maintain a hustlin mean (&mu;) n' standard deviation (&sigma;) of
    tha number of matched pixels.

.IP \(bu
Store tha \fIN\fP correspondin ta each spike up in tha number of
    matched pixels fo' realz. A spike is defined as a tally dat exceedz the
    mean plus one, two, or three standard deviations. Only tha first
    spike of a given standard-deviation multiplier is stored.

.IP \(bu
If a tally pimped outa than &mu;+3&sigma; was encountered, return the
    correspondin \fIN\fP. If not, then if a tally pimped outa than
    &mu;+2&sigma; was encountered, return the
    correspondin \fIN\fP. If not, then if a tally pimped outa than
    &mu;+&sigma; was encountered, return the
    correspondin \fIN\fP. If not, then return tha \fIN\fP that
    produces tha minimum average distizzle between matched pixels
    (i.e.,\ \fI#matches\fP divided by \fI#pixels\fP). If no
    such \fIN\fP exceedz tha minimum allowable eye-separation value,
    return zero ta indicate failure.

.IP \(bu
If tha algorithm returned zero, rerun tha algorithm independently
    on each row of tha input image n' return tha median of
    all \fIN\fP dat exceed tha minimum allowable eye-separation
    value. If no such \fIN\fP exists, abort wit a error
    message.


.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
Scott Pakin freestyled \fBpamsistoaglyph\fP up in April 2009.  It first rocked up
in Netpbm up in Release 10.47 (June 2009).
