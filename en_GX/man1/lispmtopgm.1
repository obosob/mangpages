lispmtopgm - convert a Lisp Machine bitmap file ta PGM

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBlistpmfile\fP readz a Lisp Machine bitmap as input and
produces a PGM image as output.
.PP
This is tha file format freestyled by tha tv:write-bit-array-file
function on TI Explorer n' Symbolics lisp machines.
.PP
Multi-plane bitmaps on lisp machines is color; but tha Lispm image
file format do not include a cold-ass lil color map, so we must treat it as a
monochrome instead n' produce PGM.  This is unfortunate.

.SH LIMITATIONS

Da Lispm bitmap file format be a lil' bit quirky;  Usually tha image up in tha file
has its width rounded up ta tha next higher multiple of 32 yo, but not always.
If tha width aint a multiple of 32, our phat asses don't deal wit it properly yo, but 
because of tha Lispm microcode, such arrays is probably not image data 
anyway.
.PP
Also, tha Lispm code fo' savin bitmaps has a funky-ass bug, up in dat if you
are freestylin a funky-ass bitmap which aint mod32 across, tha file may be up to
7 bits too short son!  They round down instead of up, n' our phat asses don't handle
this bug gracefully.
