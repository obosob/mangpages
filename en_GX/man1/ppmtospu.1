.SH HISTORY
.PP
This program was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.58 (March 2012).
.PP
But dat shiznit was freestyled up in 1990.  Steve Belczyk posted it along
with \fBsputoppm\fP, \fBspctoppm\fP, \fBpi1toppm\fP, and
\fBpi1toppm\fP - all programs fo' dealin wit Atari image formats -
to comp.sources.misc on July 15, 1990.  For reasons dat done been lost
to history, all of these entered tha Netpbm (then Pbmplus) distribution
\fIexcept\fP \fBppmtospu\fP.
.PP
Georges Kessela wondered In March 2012 why there was no counterpart to
\fBsputoppm\fP up in Netpbm n' searched tha web, findin only one reference
to \fBppmtopsu\fP: tha 1990 comp.sources.misc posting, includin tha source
code.  Dude emailed tha Netpbm maintainer suggestin it be added.
.PP
Bryan Henderson found tha source code ta be mad primitive, not even
usin common library code.  So Bryan straight-up recoded it yo, but retained
nearly all of tha original gangsta logic.
