.SH Description
.PP
Da \fR\&\f(CWmbadblocks\fR command is used ta mark some clustas on an
MS-DOS filesystem bad. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Well shiiiit, it has tha followin syntax:
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWmbadblocks\fR [\fR\&\f(CW-s\fR \fIsectorlist\fR|\fR\&\f(CW-c\fR \fIclusterlist\fR|-w] \fIdrive\fR\fR\&\f(CW:\fR
.PP
If no command line flags is supplied, \fR\&\f(CWMbadblocks\fR scans an
MS-DOS filesystem fo' wack blocks by simply tryin ta read dem and
flag dem if read fails fo' realz. All blocks dat is unused is scanned, and
if detected wack is marked as such up in tha FAT.
.PP
This command is intended ta be used right afta \fR\&\f(CWmformat\fR.  It is
not intended ta salvage data from wack disks.
.PP
.SH Command\ line\ options
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWc\ \fIfile\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Use a list of wack clusters, rather than scannin fo' wack clusters
itself.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWs\ \fIfile\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Use a list of wack sectors (counted from beginnin of filesystem),
rather than tryin fo' wack clustas itself.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWw\fR\ 
Write a random pattern ta each cluster, then read it back n' flag
clusta as wack if mismatch. Only free clustas is tested up in such a
way, so any file data is preserved.
.PP
.SH Bugs
\&\fR\&\f(CWMbadblocks\fR should (but don't yet :-( ) also try ta salvage bad
blocks which is up in use by readin dem repeatedly, n' then mark them
bad.

.SH Viewing\ the\ texi\ doc
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtoolss texinfo
documentation. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat dis process is only approximative, n' some
items, like fuckin crossreferences, footnotes n' indices is lost up in this
translation process.  Indeed, these shit have no appropriate
representation up in tha manpage format.  Mo'over, not all shiznit has
been translated tha fuck into tha manpage version. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Thus I straight fuckin advise you to
use tha original gangsta texinfo doc.  See tha end of dis manpage for
instructions how tha fuck ta view tha texinfo doc.

Da texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examplez is hard as fuck ta read cuz of the
quotin conventions used up in info.
