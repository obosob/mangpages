.SH NAME
pbmtopgm - convert PBM image ta PGM by averagin areas

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpbmtopgm \fP
\fIwidth\fP
\fIheight\fP
[\fIpbmfile\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpbmtopgm\fP readz a PBM image as input.  It outputs a PGM image
in which each pixelz gray level is tha average of tha surrounding
black n' white input pixels.  Da surroundin area be a rectangle of
\fIwidth\fP by \fIheight\fP pixels.
.PP
In other lyrics, dis be a cold-ass lil convolution. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  \fBpbmtopgm\fP is similar
to a special case of \fBpnmconvol\fP.
.PP
Yo ass may need a \fBpnmsmooth\fP step afta \fBpbmtopgm\fP.
.PP
\fBpbmtopgm\fP has tha effect of anti-aliasin bitmaps which
contain distinct line features.
.PP
\fBpbmtopgm\fP works dopest wit odd sample width n' heights.
.PP
Yo ass don't need \fBpbmtopgm\fP just ta bust a PGM program on a PBM
image.  Any PGM program (assumin it uses tha Netpbm libraries ta read
the PGM input) takes PBM input as if it was PGM, wit only the
minimum n' maximum gray levels.  So unless yo' convolution rectangle
is bigger than one pixel, you not bustin anythang wit a
\fBpbmtopgm\fP step.
.PP
Da opposite transformation (which would turn a PGM tha fuck into a PBM) is
dithering.  See \fBpamditherbw\fP.
