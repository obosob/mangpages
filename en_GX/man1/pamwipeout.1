[\fB\fIfilename\fP\fP]
.PP
Minimum unique abbreviation of options be acceptable. 
Yo ass may use double hyphens instead of single hyphen ta denote options.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
Da \fBpamwipeout\fP utilitizzle takes a Neptbm image as input n' tha uses
two opposite edgez of tha image ta wipe up anythang up in between. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Yo ass can use
it up in combination wit \fBpamcut\fP n' \fBpnmpaste\fP / \fBpamcomp\fP to
remove unwanted partz of a larger image.  Da program replaces tha pixels in
between tha two edges wit a gradient from one edge ta tha other.
.PP
In \fBtop-bottom\fP mode, tha program readz tha whole image tha fuck into memory
before it can start processing.  In \fBleft-right\fP it will read tha image a
row all up in tha time, process dat row n' write it ta tha output file.  Therefore,
in case of straight-up big-ass images, it may be betta ta use instead of
"\fBpamwipeout -tb\fP" a pipe of "\fBpamflip -cw | pamwipeout -lr | pamflip
-ccw\fP".
