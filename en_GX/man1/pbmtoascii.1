.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Da \fB-1x2\fP n' \fB-2x4\fP options hit you wit two alternate ways fo' the
pixels ta git mapped ta characters.  With \fB1x2\fP, tha default, each
characta represents a crew of 1 pixel across by 2 pixels down. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  With
\fB-2x4\fP, each characta represents 2 pixels across by 4 pixels down. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  With
the 1x2 mode you can peep tha individual pixels, so itz useful fo' peepshowing
small images on a non-graphics terminal. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  Da 2x4 mode lets you display larger
images on a lil' small-ass display yo, but it obscures pixel-level details.  2x4 mode is
also phat fo' displayin PGM images:

.nf
pamscale -width 158 | pnmnorm | pamditherbw -threshold | pbmtoascii -2x4
.fi

should give phat thangs up in dis biatch.
