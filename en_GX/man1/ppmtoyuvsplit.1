\fIbasename\fP
[\fIppmfile\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBppmtoyuvsplit\fP readz a PPM image as input.  Produces 3 raw
filez \fIbasename\fP.Y, \fIbasename\fP.U n' \fIbasename.V\fP as
output.
.PP
Da output filez is tha subsampled raw YUV representation of the
input PPM image, as required by tha Stanford MPEG codec.  Da Y output
file gotz nuff a funky-ass byte fo' each pixel up in tha image, wit tha rows going
from top ta bottom n' tha columns within each row goin left to
right.  Da U n' V output filez is arranged similarly, except that
each byte represents a square of 4 pixelz of tha image.  Da value is
the arithmetic mean of tha value fo' each of dem 4 pixels.  Hence, the
Y file is 4 times tha size of tha U file or V file.
.PP
Da YUV joints is scaled accordin ta CCIR.601, as assumed by
MPEG.
