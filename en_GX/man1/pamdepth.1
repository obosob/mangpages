.SH NAME

pamdepth - chizzle tha maxval up in a Netpbm image

.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpamdepth\fP \fInewmaxval\fP [\fInetpbmfile\fP]

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamdepth\fP readz a Netpbm image as input, scalez all tha pixel
values, n' writes up tha image wit tha freshly smoked up maxval. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  Scalin the
colors down ta a smalla maxval will result up in some loss of
information.
.PP
This program works on multi-image streams.
.PP
Be careful of off-by-one errors when choosin tha freshly smoked up maxval. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  For
instance, if you want tha color joints ta be five bits wide, use a
maxval of 31, not 32.
.PP
One blingin use of \fBpamdepth\fP is ta convert a freshly smoked up format
2-byte-per-sample PNM file ta tha olda 1-byte-per-sample format.
Before April 2000, essentially all raw (binary) format PNM filez had a
maxval less than 256 n' one byte per sample, n' nuff programs may
rely on dis shit.  If you specify a \fInewmaxval\fP less than 256, the
resultin file should be readable by any program dat hit dat shiznit wit PNM
filez before April 2000.

.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
\fBpamdepth\fP was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006).  It replaced
\fBpnmdepth\fP, by Jef Poskanzer n' shit.  \fBpamdepth\fP is backward compatible
with \fBpnmdepth\fP n' addz tha mobilitizzle ta process arbitrary PAM images
and tha mobilitizzle ta process multi-image input streams.  \fBpnmdepth\fP
handled only PNM images n' ignored all but tha straight-up original gangsta up in any stream.
