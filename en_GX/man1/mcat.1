.SH Description
.PP
Da \fR\&\f(CWmcat\fR command is used ta copy a entire disk image from or
to tha floppy device. Well shiiiit, it uses tha followin syntax:
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWmcat\fR [\fR\&\f(CW-w\fR] \fIdrive\fR\fR\&\f(CW:\fR
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMcat\fR performs tha same ol' dirty task as tha Unix \fR\&\f(CWcat\fR command. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! It
is included tha fuck into tha mtools package, since \fR\&\f(CWcat\fR cannot access
remote floppy devices offered by tha mtools floppy daemon.
Now it is possible ta create boot floppies remotely.
.PP
Da default operation is reading. Da output is freestyled ta stdout.
.PP
If tha \fR\&\f(CW-w\fR option is specified, mcat readz a gangbangin' finger-lickin' disk-image from 
stdin n' writes it ta tha given device. 
\&\fBUse dis carefully!\fR Because of tha low-level nature of dis 
command, it will happily destroy any data freestyled before on the
disk without warning!

This manpage has been automatically generated from mtoolss texinfo
documentation. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat dis process is only approximative, n' some
items, like fuckin crossreferences, footnotes n' indices is lost up in this
translation process.  Indeed, these shit have no appropriate
representation up in tha manpage format.  Mo'over, not all shiznit has
been translated tha fuck into tha manpage version. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Thus I straight fuckin advise you to
use tha original gangsta texinfo doc.  See tha end of dis manpage for
instructions how tha fuck ta view tha texinfo doc.

Da texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examplez is hard as fuck ta read cuz of the
quotin conventions used up in info.
