.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpnmquant\fP readz a PNM image as input.  It chizzlez \fIncolors\fP
colors ta dopest represent tha image, maps tha existin colors
to tha freshly smoked up ones, n' writes a PNM image as output.
.PP
All options can be abbreviated ta they shortest unique prefix.  You
may use two hyphens instead of one ta designate a option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Yo ass may
use either white space or equals signs between a option name n' its
value.
.PP
This program is simply a cold-ass lil combination of \fBpnmcolormap\fP and
\fBpnmremap\fP, where tha flavaz of tha input is remapped rockin a
color map which is generated from tha flavas up in dat same input.  The
options have tha same meanin as up in dem programs.  See their
documentation ta KNOW \fBpnmquant\fP.
.PP
It be much fasta ta booty-call \fBpnmcolormap\fP n' \fBpnmremap\fP
directly than ta run \fBpnmquant\fP.  Yo ass save tha overhead of the
Perl interpreta n' bustin two extra processes.  \fBpnmquant\fP is
just a cold-ass lil convenience.
.PP
\fBpnmquant\fP did not exist before Netpbm 9.21 (January 2001).
Before that, \fBppmquant\fP did tha same thang yo, but only on PPM
images.  \fBppmquant\fP continues ta exist yo, but is only a gangbangin' front end
(for name compatibility) ta \fBpnmquant\fP.
