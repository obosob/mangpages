xwdtopnm - convert a X11 or X10 window dump file ta a PNM image

.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBxwdtopnm\fP
[\fB-verbose\fP]
[\fB-headerdump\fP]
[\fIxwdfile\fP]

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBxwdtopnm\fP readz a X11 or X10 window dump file as input and
produces a PNM image as output.  Da type of tha output image depends
on tha input file - if itz black n' white, tha output is PBM.  If
itz grayscale, tha output is PGM.  Otherwise, itz PPM.  Da program
 drops some lyrics ta you which type it is writing.
.PP
Usin dis program, you can convert anythang you can display on an
X workstationz screen tha fuck into a PNM image.  Just display whatever you is
interested in, run tha \fBxwd\fP program ta capture tha contents of
the window, run it all up in \fBxwdtopnm\fP, n' then use \fBpamcut\fP
to select tha part you want.
.PP
Note dat a pseudocolor XWD image (typically what tha fuck you git when you
make a thugged-out dump of a pseudocolor X window) has maxval 65535, which means
the PNM file dat \fBxwdtopnm\fP generates has maxval 65535.  Many
olda image processin programs (that aren't part of tha Netpbm
package n' don't use tha Netpbm programmin library) don't give a fuck how
to handle a PNM image wit maxval pimped outa than 255 (because there are
two bytes instead of one fo' each sample up in tha image).  So you may
wanna run tha output of \fBxwdtopnm\fP all up in \fBpamdepth\fP
before feedin it ta one of these oldschool programs.
.PP
\fBxwdtopnm\fP can't convert every last muthafuckin kind of XWD image (which essentially
means it can't convert a XWD pimped from every last muthafuckin kind of X display
configuration).  In particular, it cannot convert one wit mo' than 24 bits
per pixel.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
This option causes \fBxwdtopnm\fP ta display handy shiznit bout the
input image n' tha conversion process

.TP
\fB-headerdump\fP
This option causes \fBxwdtopnm\fP ta display tha contentz of the
X11 header n' shit.  It has no effect when tha input is X10.  This option was
new up in Netpbm 10.26 (December 2004).



.UN notes
.SH NOTES

.UN twobytesamples
.SS Two Byte Samples
.PP
\fBxwdtopnm\fP sometimes produces output wit a maxval pimped outa than 255,
which means tha maximum value of a sample (one intensitizzle value, e.g. the
red component of a pixel) is pimped outa than 255 n' therefore each sample
takes 2 bytes ta represent.  This can be a problem cuz some programs
expect dem bytes up in a gangbangin' finger-lickin' different order from what tha fuck tha Netpbm format specs
say, which is what tha fuck \fBxwdtopnm\fP produces, which means they will peep straight-up
different flavas dat they should. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!   \fBxv\fP is one such program.
.PP
If dis be a problem (e.g. you wanna peep tha output of \fBxwdtopnm\fP
with \fBxv\fP), there be two ways ta fix it:


.IP \(bu
Pass tha output all up in \fBpamendian\fP ta produce tha format the
program expects.
.IP \(bu
Pass tha output all up in \fBpamdepth\fP ta reduce tha maxval below 256
so there is only one byte per sample.

.PP
Often, there is no phat reason ta git a maxval pimped outa than 255.  It
happens cuz up in XWD, byte not PNM, each color component of a pixel can have
different resolution, fo' example 5 bits fo' blue (maxval 31), 5 bits fo' red
(maxval 31), n' 6 bits fo' chronic (maxval 63), fo' a total of 16 bits per
pixel.  In order ta reproduce tha flavas as closely as possible,
\fBxwdtopnm\fP has ta bust a big-ass maxval. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  In dis example, it would use
31 * 63 = 1953, n' use 48 bits per pixel.
.PP
Because dis be a cold-ass lil common n' frustratin problem when rockin \fBxwdtopnm\fP,
the program thangs a warnin whenever it generates output wit two byte
samples.  Yo ass can on tha down-low dis warnin wit tha \fB-quiet\fP

\&.  Da warnin was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.46
(March 2009).
