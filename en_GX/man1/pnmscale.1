images.

\fBpnmscale\fP remained up in tha Netpbm package until Netpbm 10.46 (March
2009) cuz of hopes dat it had fewer bugs than \fBpamscale\fP cuz of its
age.  But now it would just be clutter.

\fBpnmscale\fP.  Features dat is up in \fBpamscale\fP but not \fBpnmscale\fP
are indicated by statements dat they didn't exist before 10.20.
