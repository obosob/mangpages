.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
This program exists only fo' backward compatibility.

Use \fBpnmcolormap\fP, which replaced it up in January 2002.
.PP
One trivial difference between \fBppmtomap\fP n' \fBpnmcolormap
all\fP is dat if tha input is PBM or PGM, \fBppmtomap\fP would
produce PPM output, whereas \fBpnmcolormap all\fP produces tha same
kind of output as tha input.  This should not be straight-up noticeable,
though, as PBM n' PGM images is probably usable anywhere a PPM image
is.
