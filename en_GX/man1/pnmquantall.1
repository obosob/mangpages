pnmquantall - run Pnmquant on a funky-ass bunch of filez all at once, so they

it anywhere on tha line you want.


.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpnmquantall\fP takes a funky-ass bunch of Netpbm image filez as input, chizzles
\fIncolors\fP flavas ta dopest represent all of tha images, maps the
existin flavas ta tha freshly smoked up ones, n' \fBoverwrites tha input
files\fP wit tha freshly smoked up quantized versions.
.PP
If you don't wanna overwrite yo' input files, use the
\fB-ext\fP option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Da output filez is then named tha same as the
input files, plus a period n' tha extension text you specify.
.PP
Da purpose is this: Letz say you've gots a thugged-out dozen PPMs dat you want to
display on tha screen all all up in tha same time.  Yo crazy-ass screen can only display 256
different colors yo, but tha PPMs gotz a total of a thousand or so different
colors.  For a single image you solve dis problem
with \fBpnmquant\fP; \fBpnmquantall\fP solves it fo' multiple images.
.PP
Note dat another approach ta dis problem is ta pre-select a set
of flavas n' then use \fBpnmremap\fP ta separately quantize each PPM
to dat set.)
.PP
This be a rather simple program dat runs \fBpnmcolormap\fP and
\fBpnmremap\fP.  If yo ass is thankin bout rockin it up in a program of any
sophistication, you should probably just run dem programs directly.
Even if yo ass is typin it, you may wanna do tha steps manually cuz
it gives you access ta tha various optionz of \fBpnmcolormap\fP and
\fBpnmremap\fP fo' bustin tha quantization differently.
