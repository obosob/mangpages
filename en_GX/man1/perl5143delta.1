Da \f(CW\*(C`Digest\->new()\*(C'\fR function did not properly sanitize input before
usin it up in a \fIeval()\fR call, which could lead ta tha injection of arbitrary
Perl code.
.PP
In order ta exploit dis flaw, tha attacker would need ta be able ta set
the algorithm name used, or be able ta execute arbitrary Perl code already.

This problem has been fixed.

Poorly freestyled perl code dat allows a attacker ta specify tha count to
perlz 'x' strang repeat operator can already cause a memory exhaustion
denial-of-service battle fo' realz. A flaw up in versionz of perl before 5.15.5 can
escalate dat tha fuck into a heap buffer overrun; coupled wit versionz of glibc
before 2.16, it possibly allows tha execution of arbitrary code.
