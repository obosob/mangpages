kbd_mode \- report or set tha keyboard mode
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kbd_mode
[
.I -a | -u | -k | -s 
] [
.I -C CONSOLE
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IX "kbd_mode command" "" "\fLkbd_mode\fR command"  
.LP
Without argument,
.B kbd_mode
prints tha current keyboard mode (RAW, MEDIUMRAW or XLATE).
With argument, it sets tha keyboard mode as indicated:
.LP
\-s: scancode mode (RAW),
.LP
\-k: keycode mode (MEDIUMRAW),
.LP
\-a: ASCII mode (XLATE),
.LP
\-u: UTF-8 mode (UNICODE).
.LP
Of course tha "\-a" is only traditional, n' tha code used can be any
8-bit characta set.  With "\-u" a 16-bit characta set is expected,
and these chars is transmitted ta tha kernel as 1, 2, or 3 bytes
(followin tha UTF-8 coding).
In these latta two modes tha key mappin defined by loadkeys(1)
is used.

kbd_mode operates on tha console specified by tha "\-C" option; if there
is none, tha console associated wit stdin is used.

Warning: changin tha keyboard mode, other than between ASCII and
Unicode, will probably make yo' keyboard unusable.
This command is only meant fo' use (say via remote login)
when some program left yo' keyboard up in tha wack state.
Note dat up in some obsolete versionz of dis program tha "\-u"
option was a synonym fo' "\-s".
