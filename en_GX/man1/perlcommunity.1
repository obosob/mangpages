.SH "NAME"
perlcommunitizzle \- a funky-ass brief overview of tha Perl hood
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document aims ta provide a overview of tha vast perl hood, which is
far too big-ass n' diverse ta provide a thugged-out detailed listing. If any specific niche
has been forgotten, it aint meant as a insult but a omission fo' tha sake
of brevity.
.PP
Da Perl hood be as diverse as Perl, n' there be a big-ass amount of
evidence dat tha Perl playas apply \s-1TMTOWTDI\s0 ta all endeavors, not just
programming. From joints, ta \s-1IRC,\s0 ta mailin lists, there is mo' than one
way ta git involved up in tha hood.
.SS "Where ta Find tha Community"
.IX Subsection "Where ta Find tha Community"
There be a cold-ass lil central directory fo' tha Perl hood: <http://perl.org>
maintained by tha Perl Foundation (<http://www.perlfoundation.org/>),
which tracks n' serves up skillz fo' a variety of other hood cribs.
.SS "Mailin Lists n' Shitgroups"
.IX Subsection "Mailin Lists n' Shitgroups"
Perl runs on e\-mail; there is no diggity bout dat shit. Da Camel book was originally
written mostly over e\-mail n' todizzle Perlz pimpment is co-ordinated through
mailin lists, n' you can put dat on yo' toast. Da phattest repository of Perl mailin lists is located at
<http://lists.perl.org>.
.PP
Most Perl-related projects set up mailin lists fo' both playas and
contributors. If you don't peep a cold-ass lil certain project listed at
<http://lists.perl.org>, check tha particular joint fo' dat project.
Most mailin lists is archived at <http://nntp.perl.org/>.
.PP
There is also nuff Perl related newsgroups located under
\&\f(CW\*(C`comp.lang.perl.*\*(C'\fR.
.SS "\s-1IRC\s0"
.IX Subsection "IRC"
Da Perl hood has a rather big-ass \s-1IRC\s0 presence. For starters, it has its
own \s-1IRC\s0 network, <irc://irc.perl.org>. General (not help-oriented) chat can be
found at <irc://irc.perl.org/#perl>. Many other mo' specific chats is also
hosted on tha network yo. Hype bout irc.perl.org is located on the
networkz joint: <http://www.irc.perl.org>. For a mo' help-oriented #perl,
check up <irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl>. Perl 6 pimpment also has a
presence up in <irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl6>. Most Perl-related channels will
be kind enough ta point you up in tha right direction if you ask sickly.
.PP
Any big-ass \s-1IRC\s0 network (Dalnet, EFnet) be also likely ta git a #perl channel,
with varyin activitizzle levels.
.SS "Websites"
.IX Subsection "Websites"
Perl joints come up in a variety of forms yo, but they fit tha fuck into two large
categories: forums n' shizzle joints, n' you can put dat on yo' toast. There is nuff Perl-related
websites, so only all dem of tha hoodz phattest is mentioned here.
.PP
\fIShit cribs\fR
.IX Subsection "Shit cribs"
.IP "<http://perl.com/>" 4
.IX Item "<http://perl.com/>"
Run by O'Reilly Media (the publisher of tha Camel Book, among other
Perl-related literature), perl.com serves up current Perl hype, articles, and
resources fo' Perl pimpers as well as a gangbangin' finger-lickin' directory of other useful joints.
.IP "<http://blogs.perl.org/>" 4
.IX Item "<http://blogs.perl.org/>"
Many thugz of tha hood gotz a Perl-related Snoop Bloggy-Blogg on dis crib. If
you'd like ta join them, you can sign up fo' free.
.IP "<http://use.perl.org/>" 4
.IX Item "<http://use.perl.org/>"
use Perl; used ta provide a slashdot-style news/Snoop Bloggy-Blogg joint coverin all
things Perl, from minutez of tha meetingz of tha Perl 6 Design crew to
conference announcements wit (ir)relevant rap. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. Well shiiiit, it no longer accepts
updates yo, but you can still use tha joint ta read oldschool entries n' comments.
.PP
\fIForums\fR
.IX Subsection "Forums"
.IP "<http://www.perlmonks.org/>" 4
.IX Item "<http://www.perlmonks.org/>"
PerlMonks is one of tha phattest Perl forums, n' raps bout itself as \*(L"A place
for dudes ta polish, improve, n' showcase they Perl game.\*(R" n' \*(L"A
communitizzle which allows mah playas ta grow n' learn from each other.\*(R"
.IP "<http://stackoverflow.com/>" 4
.IX Item "<http://stackoverflow.com/>"
Stack Overflow be a gangbangin' free question-and-answer joint fo' programmers. It aint nuthin but not
focussed solely on Perl yo, but it do have a actizzle crew of playas whoz ass do
their dopest ta help playas wit they Perl programmin thangs.
.SS "User Groups"
.IX Subsection "User Groups"
Many ghettos round tha ghetto have local Perl Mongers chaptas fo' realz. A Perl Mongers
chapta be a local user crew which typically holdz regular in-thug meetings,
both hood n' technical; helps organize local conferences, workshops, and
hackathons; n' serves up a mailin list or other continual contact method for
its thugz ta keep up in touch.
.PP
To find yo' local Perl Mongers (or \s-1PM\s0 as they commonly abbreviated) group
check tha internationistic Perl Mongers directory at <http://www.pm.org/>.
.SS "Workshops"
.IX Subsection "Workshops"
Perl workshops are, as tha name might suggest, workshops where Perl is taught
in a variety of ways fo' realz. At tha workshops, subjects range from a funky-ass beginner's
introduction (like fuckin tha Pizzlesburgh Perl Workshopz \*(L"Zero To Perl\*(R") ta much
more advanced subjects.
.PP
There is nuff muthafuckin pimped out resources fo' locatin workshops: the
websites mentioned above, the
calendar mentioned below, n' tha \s-1YAPC\s0 Europe
website, <http://www.yapceurope.org/>, which is probably tha dopest resource for
European Perl events.
.SS "Hackathons"
.IX Subsection "Hackathons"
Hackathons is a straight-up different kind of gatherin where Perl hackers gather to
do just that, hack nonstop fo' a extended (several day) period on a specific
project or projects yo. Hype bout hackathons can be located up in tha same
place as shiznit bout workshops as well as in
<irc://irc.perl.org/#perl>.
.PP
If you have never been ta a hackathon, here is all dem basic thangs you need to
know before attending: gotz a hustlin laptop n' know how tha fuck ta use it; check out
the involved projects beforehand; have tha necessary version control client;
and brang backup shiznit (an extra \s-1LAN\s0 cable, additionizzle juice strips, etc.)
because one of mah thugs will forget.
.SS "Conventions"
.IX Subsection "Conventions"
Perl has two major annual conventions: Da Perl Conference (now part of \s-1OSCON\s0),
put on by O'Reilly, n' Yet Another Perl Conference or \s-1YAPC \s0(pronounced
yap-see), which is localized tha fuck into nuff muthafuckin regionizzle YAPCs (Uptown America,
Europe, Asia) up in a stunnin grassroots display by tha Perl hood. For more
information bout either conference, check up they respectizzle wizzy pages:
\&\s-1OSCON \s0<http://conferences.oreillynet.com/>; \s-1YAPC \s0<http://www.yapc.org>.
.PP
A relatively freshly smoked up conference franchise wit a big-ass Perl portion is the
Open Source Developers Conference or \s-1OSDC.\s0 First held up in Australia it has
recently also spread ta Israel n' France. Mo' shiznit can be found at:
<http://www.osdc.com.au/> fo' Australia, <http://www.osdc.org.il>
for Israel, n' <http://www.osdc.fr/> fo' France.
.SS "Calendar of Perl Events"
.IX Subsection "Calendar of Perl Events"
Da Perl Review, <http://www.theperlreview.com> maintains a joint
and Gizoogle calendar
(<http://www.theperlreview.com/community_calendar>) fo' tracking
workshops, hackathons, Perl Mongers meetings, n' other events, n' you can put dat on yo' toast. Views
of dis calendar is at <http://www.perl.org/events.html> and
<http://www.yapc.org>.
.PP
Not every last muthafuckin event or Perl Mongers crew is on dat calendar, so don't lose
heart if you don't peep yours posted. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time. To have yo' event or crew listed,
