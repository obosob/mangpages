Minimum unique abbreviationz of options is acceptable.  Yo ass may
use double hyphens instead of single hyphen ta denote options.  You
may use white space up in place of tha equals sign ta separate a option
name from its value.


.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpambackground\fP readz a PNM or PAM image as input.
It generates as output a PAM image dat identifies tha background area
of tha image (a mask).
.PP
To identify tha background, \fBpambackground\fP assumes tha image
is a gangbangin' foreground image, smalla than tha total image size, placed over
a single-color background. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  It assumes dat foreground image is solid
-- it aint gots holez all up in which tha background can be seen.
So up in specific, \fBpambackground\fP first identifies tha background
color, then findz all contiguous pixelz of dat color up in regions
touchin any edge of tha image.  Think of it as startin at each of
the four edges n' movin inward as far as possible until it hits
pixelz of another color (the foreground image).
.PP
\fBpambackground\fP identifies tha background color as bigs up:
If any 3 cornerz of tha image is tha same color, thatz tha background
color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  If not yo, but 2 corners is tha same color, tha background color
is tha color of a pair of identically colored corners up in dis priority
order: top, right, left, bottom.  If no two corners have tha same color,
the background color is tha color of tha upper left corner.
.PP
In a typical photograph, tha area dat you would consider the
background is nuff shadez of a cold-ass lil color, so ta \fBpambackground\fP it is
multiple flavas n' \fBpambackground\fP aint gonna meaningfully
identify tha background of yo' image.  To use \fBpambackground\fP in
this case, you might use \fBppmchange\fP ta chizzle all similar colors
to a single one first.  For example, if tha photograph be a funky-ass building
against a funky-ass blue sky, where not a god damn thang remotely sky-blue appears up in the
building, you could use \fBppmchange\fP ta chizzle all pixels within
20% of 'SkyBlue' ta SkyBlue, then run \fBpambackground\fP
on dat shit.
.PP
In Release 10.37, \fBpambackground\fP do not straight-up
do what tha fuck is promised above.  It can't peep places where tha background
appears up in tha middle of a row (think of tha sky between two buildings).
From Release 10.38 forward, it snakes all up in whatever passages it has to
to find all tha background.
.PP
Da PAM dat \fBpambackground\fP creates has a single plane, with
a maxval of 1.  Da sample value 1 means background; 0 means
foreground. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  There is no tuple type.  Some olda programs (but none
that is part of Netpbm) don't give a fuck what tha fuck a PAM be n' expect a mask to
be up in tha form of a PGM or PBM image.  To convert
\fBpambackground\fPz output ta PBM, use \fBpamtopnm -assume\fP.  To
convert ta PGM, use \fBpgmtopgm\fP.
.PP
\fInetpbmfile\fP is tha file justification of tha input file, or
\fB-\fP ta indicate Standard Input.  Da default is Standard Input.
.PP
A common use fo' a funky-ass background mask is wit \fBpamcomp\fP.  You
could replace tha entire background (or foreground) of yo' 
image wit suttin' else.
.PP
Another common use is ta cook up a image wit tha background
transparent (in some image format dat has a cold-ass lil concept of transparency;
not Netpbm formats) so dat image can be overlaid onto another image
later n' shit.  Netpbmz convertas ta image formats dat have transparency
(e.g. PNG) let you use tha mask dat \fBpambackground\fP generates
to identify tha transparent areas fo' tha output.
.PP
To simply cook up a mask of all tha areaz of a specified color, use
\fBppmcolormask\fP.  If you gotz a unique background color (one that
doesn't occur up in tha foreground) n' know what tha fuck it is, dis can create
a background mask up in cases dat \fBpambackground\fP cannot: where there
are see-all up in holez up in tha foreground image.
