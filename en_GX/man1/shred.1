.SH NAME
shred \- overwrite a gangbangin' file ta hide its contents, n' optionally delete it
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B shred
[\fIOPTION\fR]... \fIFILE\fR...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additionizzle description here
.PP
Overwrite tha specified FILE(s) repeatedly, up in order ta make it harder
for even straight-up high-rollin' hardware probin ta recover tha data.
.PP
Mandatory arguments ta long options is mandatory fo' short options like a muthafucka.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-force\fR
change permissions ta allow freestylin if necessary
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-iterations\fR=\fIN\fR
overwrite N times instead of tha default (3)
.TP
\fB\-\-random\-source\fR=\fIFILE\fR
get random bytes from FILE
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-size\fR=\fIN\fR
shred dis nuff bytes (suffixes like K, M, G accepted)
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-remove\fR
truncate n' remove file afta overwriting
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
show progress
.TP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-exact\fR
do not round file sizes up ta tha next full block;
.IP
this is tha default fo' non\-regular files
.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-zero\fR
add a gangbangin' final overwrite wit zeros ta hide shredding
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display dis help n' exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version shiznit n' exit
.PP
If FILE is \-, shred standard output.
.PP
Delete FILE(s) if \fB\-\-remove\fR (\fB\-u\fR) is specified. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  Da default aint ta remove
the filez cuz it is common ta operate on thang filez like /dev/hda,
and dem filez probably should not be removed. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  When operatin on regular
files, most playas use tha \fB\-\-remove\fR option.
.PP
CAUTION: Note dat shred relies on a straight-up blingin assumption:
that tha file system overwrites data up in place.  This is tha traditional
way ta do thangs yo, but nuff modern file system designs do not satisfy this
assumption. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Da followin is examplez of file systems on which shred is
not effective, or aint guaranteed ta be effectizzle up in all file system modes:
.PP
* log\-structured or journaled file systems, like fuckin dem supplied with
AIX n' Solaris (and JFS, ReiserFS, XFS, Ext3, etc.)
.PP
* file systems dat write redundant data n' carry on even if some writes
fail, like fuckin RAID\-based file systems
.PP
* file systems dat make snapshots, like fuckin Network Appliancez NFS server
.PP
* file systems dat cache up in temporary locations, like fuckin NFS
version 3 clients
.PP
* compressed file systems
.PP
In tha case of ext3 file systems, tha above disclaimer applies
(and shred is thuz of limited effectiveness) only up in data=journal mode,
which journals file data up in addizzle ta just metadata.  In both the
data=ordered (default) n' data=writeback modes, shred works as usual.
Ext3 journalin modes can be chizzled by addin tha data=suttin' option
to tha mount options fo' a particular file system up in tha /etc/fstab file,
as documented up in tha mount playa page (man mount).
.PP
In addition, file system backups n' remote mirrors may contain copies
of tha file dat cannot be removed, n' dat will allow a gangbangin' finger-lickin' dirty-ass shredded file
to be recovered later.
