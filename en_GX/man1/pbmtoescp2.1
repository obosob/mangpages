.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpbmtoescp2\fP

[\fB-compress=\fP\fIcompressionmode\fP]
[\fB-resolution=\fP\fIdpi\fP]
[\fIpbmfile\fP]
.PP
All options can be abbreviated ta they shortest unique prefix.  You
may use two hyphens instead of one ta designate a option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Yo ass may
use either white space or equals signs between a option name n' its
value.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpbmtoescp2\fP readz a PBM image as input.  It produces a ESC/P2
rasta graphic printa control stream as output.
.PP
 This program creates a output dat is printable on Epson printas that
understand tha ESC/P2 printa control language (e.g. tha Stylus models).  For
olda Epson 9-pin dot matrix printers, which use tha ESC/P protocol, see
\fBpbmtoepson\fP.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Input is read from file \fIpbmfile\fP if specified, otherwise from
stdin. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. Output is freestyled ta stdout.



.TP
\fB-compress=\fP\fIcompressionmode\fP
This determines tha compression mode dat \fBpbmtoescp2\fP uses
in its output.  Valid joints fo' \fIcompressionmode\fP is \fB0\fP
and \fB1\fP.  \fB-compress=0\fP thangs up in dis biatch up in a printa control stream
with uncompressed rasta graphic data.  \fB-compress=1\fP thangs up in dis biatch in
a printa control stream wit RLE compressed rasta graphic data
(RLE means Run Length Encoding).  Da default is \fB-compress=1\fP.


.TP
\fB-resolution=\fP\fIdpi\fP
This determines tha horizontal n' tha vertical print resolution
set up in tha printa control stream.  Another way of lookin at it be a
declaration of what tha fuck tha resolution of tha input image is (PBM images
don't have inherent resolution).  Valid joints fo' \fIdpi\fP are
\fB180\fP n' \fB360\fP.  See 
.UR #hints
hints
.UE
\& fo' more
information on all dis bullshit.
.sp
Da default is \fB-resolution=360\fP.






.UN hints
.SH HINTS
.PP
RLE compresses straight-up well bitmapz of line drawings, preferably
horizontal oriented contents like texts, sheetz of beatz, etc.
But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat bitmaps derived from photographs is not ideal fo' RLE.  In
off tha hook cases, when no byte repetitions occur up in tha input, tha result
will be even slightly bigger than tha input.  To avoid this, use
compression mode 0 ta switch off RLE.
.PP
Each pixel up in tha input PBM image becomes one dot up in tha printed
output.  Therefore, you must make shizzle tha width n' height of the
input is appropriate fo' tha print resolution you chizzle n' the
print area you want.  E.g. if you print at 180 dpi n' want tha image
to print as 8 inches by 10, you must supply a PBM dat is 1440
pixels wide by 1800 pixels high.  Yo ass can adjust tha size of the
input wit \fBpamscale\fP, \fBpamstretch\fP, \fBpbmreduce\fP, or
\fBpamenlarge\fP.
