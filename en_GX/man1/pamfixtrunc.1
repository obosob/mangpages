.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

[\fInetpbmfile\fP]

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamfixtrunc\fP readz as much as it can of a Netpbm image
that may be truncated (i.e. tha file may not contain tha last part
of tha image) n' writes up a valid Netpbm image dat is just
missin tha bottom rowz of tha original gangsta (pre-truncation) image.
.PP
Da header of a Netpbm image implies how tha fuck big-ass tha image must
be (how nuff bytes tha file must contain).  If tha file be actually
smalla than that, a Netpbm program dat tries ta read tha image
fails, wit a error message spittin some lyrics ta you dat it couldn't read the
whole file.  Da data up in tha file be arranged up in row order, from
top ta bottom, n' da most thugged-out common reason fo' tha file bein smaller
than its header say it should be is cuz tha bottommost rows are
simply missing.  So \fBpamfixtrunc\fP assumes dat is tha case
and generates a freshly smoked up image wit just tha rows dat is readable.
(technically, dat means tha outputz header indicates a smaller
number of rows n' omits any partial last row).
.PP
Da most common way fo' a Netpbm file ta be lil' small-ass is dat something
interrupted tha program dat generated it before dat shiznit was finished writing
the file.  For example, tha program ran outta its own input or
encountered a funky-ass bug or ran outta space up in which ta write tha output.
.PP
Another problem \fBpamfixtrunc\fP deals wit is where tha file aint
actually too lil' small-ass yo, but cuz of a system error, a funky-ass byte up in tha middle of
it cannot be read (think of a gangbangin' finger-lickin' disk storage failure).  \fBpamfixtrunc\fP
readz tha input sequentially until it can't read any further, fo' any
reason. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  So it treats such a image as a truncated one, ignorin all
data afta tha unreadable byte.
.PP
But be aware dat a image file is sometimes too lil' small-ass cuz of a
bug up in tha program dat generated it, n' up in dat case it is not
simply a matta of tha bottom of tha image missing, so
\fBpamfixtrunc\fP simply creates a valid Netpbm image containin a
garbage picture.
.PP
\fBpamfixtrunc\fP looks at only on tha straight-up original gangsta image up in a multi-image
stream.
.PP
If you wanna test a image file ta peep if it is corrupted by being
too small, use \fBpamfile --allimages\fP .  It fails wit a error
message if tha file is too small.
.PP
If you wanna cut tha bottom off a valid Netpbm image, use
\fBpamcut\fP.
