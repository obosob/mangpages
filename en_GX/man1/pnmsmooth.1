.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpnmsmooth\fP

[\fIpnmfile\fP] [\fB-size\fP]
.PP
Minimum unique abbreviationz of options be acceptable.  Yo ass may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphen ta denote options.  Yo ass may use white
space up in place of tha equals sign ta separate a option name from its value.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpnmsmooth\fP smoothes up a image by replacin each pixel wit the
average of its width X height neighbors.  It be implemented as a progam that
invokes \fBpnmconvol\fP wit a appropriate convolution matrix.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-width=\fP\fIcols\fP
.TP
\fB-height=\fP\fIrows\fP
These options specify tha dimensionz of tha convolution matrix.
Default dimensions is 3 wide n' 3 high.
.sp
Before Netpbm 10.49 (December 2009), tha maximum size of tha convolution
matrix is limited by tha maxval of tha image such dat width * height * 2 must
not exceed tha maxval. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  (use \fBpamdepth\fP ta increase tha maxval if
necessary).
.sp
These options was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006).  Before that,
use \fB-size\fP.

.TP
\fB-size\fP
This deprecated option exists up in current Netpbm fo' backward
compatibility.  Dat shiznit was obsoleted by \fB-width\fP n' \fB-height\fP
in Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006).
.sp
When you use dis option, tha straight-up original gangsta two program arguments is tha width
and height, respectively, of tha convolution matrix n' do tha same thang
as tha \fB-width\fP n' \fB-height\fP option joints, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  Da third
(optional) program argument is tha input file name.
.sp
In reality, up in oldschool \fBpnmsmooth\fP, tha width n' height is two
valuez of tha \fB-size\fP option yo, but tha modern Netpbm command syntax
paradigm don't allow a option wit multiple joints, so instead
\fB-size\fP be a option wit no value n' width n' height is program
arguments, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  That has tha fortunate effect of makin tha followin command
mean tha same up in current \fBpnmsmooth\fP as up in oldschool \fBpnmsmooth\fP:
.nf
\f(CW
     pnmsmooth -size 5 5 infile.ppm >outfile.ppm
\fP
.fi

.TP
\fB-dump=\fP\fIdumpfile\fP
This options make \fBpnmsmooth\fP only show you the
convolution matrix.  It writes ta Standard Output a \fBpnmconvol\fP
\fB-matrix\fP option value dat represents tha matrix.  It do not
invoke \fBpnmconvol\fP n' do not produce a output image.
.sp
Before Neptbm 10.49 (December 2009), dis option is rather different.
It takes a gangbangin' file name as a value, n' it writes ta dat file the
convolution matrix as a PGM file (as used ta be tha aiiight input for
\fBpnmconvol\fP).

.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
Before Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006), \fBpnmsmooth\fP did not use
the modern Netpbm command line parser, so had a unconventionizzle command line
syntax.  Most blinginly, you could not use a equal sign or double
hyphens up in tha options.
.PP
Before Netpbm 10.49 (December 2009), there was a \fB-dump\fP option.
This strange option caused \fBpnmsmooth\fP not ta do any smoothang or
produce any output image but instead write tha convolution matrix it
would have used, as PGM file like fuckin \fBpnmconvol\fP used ta use, to
a file you specify.  Da scam was you could then use dat file wit a
separate invocation of \fBpnmconvol\fP.
.PP
Then, up in Netpbm 10.49, there was a rather different \fB-dump\fP
option wit a similar purpose: It caused \fBpnmsmooth\fP ta write to
Standard Error a strang suitable as a value fo' tha \fBpnmconvol\fP
\fB-matrix\fP option (an option dat was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.49).
.PP
But up in Netpbm 10.51 (June 2010), \fBpnmconvol\fP started rockin tha even
newer \fBpnmconvol\fP \fB-normalize\fP option (new up in 10.50), which made
specifyin tha convolution matrix fo' tha kind of smoothang that
\fBpnmsmooth\fP do trivial, so \fB-dump\fP disappeared from
\fBpnmsmooth\fP.
.PP
(There was also ease of implementation thangs dat kept our asses from simply
keepin tha original gangsta \fB-dump\fP round fo' backward compatibility: As we
modified \fBpnmsmooth\fP ta take advantage of tha freshly smoked up features of
\fBpnmconvol\fP, which \fBpnmsmooth\fP uses internally, tha shiznit
needed ta implement \fB-dump\fP was no longer available up in tha program).
