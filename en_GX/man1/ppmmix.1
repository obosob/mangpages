ppmmix - blend together two PPM images

.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

ppmmix \fIfadefactor\fP \fIppmfile1\fP \fIppmfile2\fP

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBppmmix\fP readz two PPM images as input n' mixes dem together
usin tha specified fade factor. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  Da fade factor may be up in tha range
from 0.0 (only ppmfile1z image data) ta 1.0 (only ppmfile2z image
data).  Anythang up in between specifies a smooth blend between tha two
images.
.PP
Da two images must have tha same dimensions n' tha same maxval. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  Before
Netpbm 10.54 (March 2011), they must also have tha same type (PBM/PGM/PPM).
.PP
Da fade factor be applied ta brightness, not light intensity.  That means
for example dat if you gotz a seriez of images you generated
usin \fBppmmix\fP of a funky-ass black n' a white image wit a linearly increasing
fade factor, yo big-ass booty is ghon peep a image gettin linearly brighter yo, but tha light
intensitizzle will increase fasta all up in tha end yo, but it ain't no stoppin cause I be still poppin'.  That is cuz it requires more
intensitizzle chizzle all up in tha bright end of tha scale than all up in tha dark end fo' the
human eye ta perceive tha same brightnizz chizzle.  This also means that
if tha original gangsta images aren't all one color, tha mixed image is distorted,
since tha intensitizzle relationshizzle between pixels is different from the
original gangsta image.
.PP
\fBpamcomp\fP be a mo' general alternative.  It allows you ta mix
imagez of different size n' ta have tha fade factor vary throughout
the image (all up in tha use of a alpha mask).  It aint gots the
same-maxval n' same-type restrictions.  It mixes light intensity, not
brightness.
