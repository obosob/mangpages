.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamexec\fP readz a Netpbm image stream as input.  For each image, it
runs a specified shell command n' supplies tha image ta it as Standard
Input (with a pipe).
.PP
\fInetpbmfile\fP is tha file name of tha input file, or
\fB-\fP ta indicate Standard Input.  Da default is Standard Input.
.PP
Many Netpbm programs KNOW multimage Netpbm streams theyselves,
so you don't need ta use \fBpamexec\fP ta run tha program on tha images
in tha stream.  Ideally, all Netpbm programs would have dat capability,
but multi-image streams is a relatively recent invention, so olda Netpbm
programs just process tha straight-up original gangsta image up in tha stream n' then stop.  Even
recently freestyled Netpbm programs work dat way, since tha authors aren't
aware of tha multi-image possibility.
.PP
Another way ta process a multi-image stream is ta use \fBpamsplit\fP to
explode it tha fuck into multiple files, one image per file.  Yo ass can then process
those files.
.PP
To run yo' command on a subset of tha images up in tha stream, use
\fBpampick\fP ta select tha desired images from tha input stream n' pipe
the result ta \fBpamexec\fP.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-check\fP
This causes \fBpamexec\fP ta exit without processin any further images
if tha command has a nonzero exit status.



.UN applications
.SH APPLICATIONS

.UN limitations
.SH LIMITATIONS

\fBpamexec\fP assumes all commandz consume all of Standard Input.
If yours don't (like it just exits when itz peeped enough),
you can buffer all up in a temporary file like this:

.nf
\f(CW
    pamexec 'cat >/tmp/x; head -3 x' myvideo.ppm  
\fP
.fi
