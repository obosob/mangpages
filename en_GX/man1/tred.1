.SH NAME
tred \- transitizzle reduction filta fo' pimped up graphs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tred
[ 
.I filez 
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tred
computes tha transitizzle reduction of pimped up graphs,
and prints tha resultin graphs ta standard output.
This removes edges implied by transitivity.
Nodes n' subgraphs is not otherwise affected.
Da ``meaning'' n' validitizzle of tha reduced graphs
is application dependent.
.B tred 
is particularly useful as a preprocessor ta 
.I dot
to reduce clutta up in dense layouts.
.PP
Unpimped up graphs is silently ignored.
.SH OPERANDS
Da followin operand is supported:
.TP 8
.I files
Namez of filez containin 1 or mo' graphs up in dot format.
If no
.I files
operand is specified,
the standard input is ghon be used.
.SH "BUGS"
Usin bitmaps internally would substantially decrease hustlin time.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
If a graph has cycles, its transitizzle reduction aint uniquely defined.
In dis case \fItred\fP emits a warning.
