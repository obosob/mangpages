.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBhost\fR
is a simple utilitizzle fo' struttin DNS lookups. Well shiiiit, it is normally used ta convert names ta IP addresses n' vice versa. When no arguments or options is given,
\fBhost\fR
prints a gangbangin' finger-lickin' dirty-ass short summary of its command line arguments n' options.
.PP
\fIname\fR
is tha domain name dat is ta be looked up. Well shiiiit, it can also be a thugged-out dotted\-decimal IPv4 address or a cold-ass lil colon\-delimited IPv6 address, up in which case
\fBhost\fR
will by default big-ass up a reverse lookup fo' dat address.
\fIserver\fR
is a optionizzle argument which is either tha name or IP address of tha name server that
\fBhost\fR
should query instead of tha server or servers listed in
\fI/etc/resolv.conf\fR.
.PP
The
\fB\-a\fR
(all) option is equivalent ta settin the
\fB\-v\fR
option n' asking
\fBhost\fR
to cook up a query of type ANY.
.PP
When the
\fB\-C\fR
option is used,
\fBhost\fR
will attempt ta display tha SOA recordz fo' unit
\fIname\fR
from all tha listed authoritatizzle name servers fo' dat unit. Da list of name servers is defined by tha NS recordz dat is found fo' tha unit.
.PP
The
\fB\-c\fR
option instructs ta cook up a DNS query of class
\fIclass\fR. This can be used ta lookup Hesiod or Chaosnet class resource records. Da default class is IN (Internet).
.PP
Verbose output is generated by
\fBhost\fR
when the
\fB\-d\fR
or
\fB\-v\fR
option is used. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Da two options is equivalent. They done been provided fo' backwardz compatibility. In previous versions, the
\fB\-d\fR
option switched on debuggin traces and
\fB\-v\fR
enabled verbose output.
.PP
List mode is selected by the
\fB\-l\fR
option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. This makes
\fBhost\fR
perform a unit transfer fo' unit
\fIname\fR. Transfer tha unit printin up tha NS, PTR n' address recordz (A/AAAA). If combined with
\fB\-a\fR
all recordz is ghon be printed.
.PP
The
\fB\-i\fR
option specifies dat reverse lookupz of IPv6 addresses should use tha IP6.INT domain as defined up in RFC1886. Da default is ta use IP6.ARPA.
.PP
The
\fB\-N\fR
option sets tha number of dots dat gotta be in
\fIname\fR
for it ta be considered absolute. Da default value is dat defined rockin tha ndots statement in
\fI/etc/resolv.conf\fR, or 1 if no ndots statement is present. Names wit fewer dots is interpreted as relatizzle names n' is ghon be searched fo' up in tha domains listed up in the
\fBsearch\fR
or
\fBdomain\fR
directizzle in
\fI/etc/resolv.conf\fR.
.PP
Da number of UDP retries fo' a lookup can be chizzled wit the
\fB\-R\fR
option.
\fInumber\fR
indicates how tha fuck nuff times
\fBhost\fR
will repeat a query dat do not git answered. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Da default number of retries is 1. If
\fInumber\fR
is wack or zero, tha number of retries will default ta 1.
.PP
Non\-recursive queries can be made via the
\fB\-r\fR
option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Settin dis option clears the
\fBRD\fR
\(em recursion desired \(em bit up in tha query which
\fBhost\fR
makes. This should mean dat tha name server receivin tha query aint gonna attempt ta resolve
\fIname\fR. The
\fB\-r\fR
option enables
\fBhost\fR
to mimic tha behavior of a name server by makin non\-recursive queries n' expectin ta receive lyrics ta dem queries dat is probably referrals ta other name servers.
.PP
By default,
\fBhost\fR
uses UDP when makin queries. Put ya muthafuckin choppers up if ya feel dis! The
\fB\-T\fR
option make it bust a TCP connection when queryin tha name server n' shit. TCP is ghon be automatically selected fo' queries dat require it, like fuckin unit transfer (AXFR) requests.
.PP
The
\fB\-4\fR
option forces
\fBhost\fR
to only use IPv4 query transport. The
\fB\-6\fR
option forces
\fBhost\fR
to only use IPv6 query transport.
.PP
The
\fB\-t\fR
option is used ta select tha query type.
\fItype\fR
can be any recognized query type: CNAME, NS, SOA, SIG, KEY, AXFR, etc. When no query type is specified,
\fBhost\fR
automatically selects a appropriate query type. By default, it looks fo' A, AAAA, n' MX recordz yo, but if the
\fB\-C\fR
option was given, queries is ghon be made fo' SOA records, n' if
\fIname\fR
is a thugged-out dotted\-decimal IPv4 address or colon\-delimited IPv6 address,
\fBhost\fR
will query fo' PTR records. If a query type of IXFR is chosen tha startin serial number can be specified by appendin a equal followed by tha startin serial number (e.g. \-t IXFR=12345678).
.PP
Da time ta wait fo' a reply can be controlled all up in the
\fB\-W\fR
and
\fB\-w\fR
options. The
\fB\-W\fR
option makes
\fBhost\fR
wait for
\fIwait\fR
seconds. If
\fIwait\fR
is less than one, tha wait interval is set ta one second. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! When the
\fB\-w\fR
option is used,
\fBhost\fR
will effectively wait forever fo' a reply. Da time ta wait fo' a response is ghon be set ta tha number of secondz given by tha hardwarez maximum value fo' a integer quantity.
.PP
The
\fB\-s\fR
option tells
\fBhost\fR
\fInot\fR
to bust tha query ta tha next nameserver if any server respondz wit a SERVFAIL response, which is tha reverse of aiiight stub resolver behavior.
.PP
The
\fB\-m\fR
can be used ta set tha memory usage debuggin flags
\fIrecord\fR,
\fIusage\fR
and
\fItrace\fR.
.SH "IDN SUPPORT"
.PP
If
\fBhost\fR
has been built wit IDN (internationalized domain name) support, it can accept n' display non\-ASCII domain names.
\fBhost\fR
appropriately converts characta encodin of domain name before bustin  a request ta DNS server or displayin a reply from tha server n' shit. If you'd like ta turn off tha IDN support fo' some reason, defines the
\fBIDN_DISABLE\fR
environment variable. Da IDN support is disabled if tha variable is set when
\fBhost\fR
runs.
