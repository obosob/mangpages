.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpgmtopgm\fP

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpgmtopgm\fP simply copies a PGM image from Standard Input to
Standard Output.  This may seem a unnecessary duplication of
\fBcat\fP yo, but remember dat a PGM program can read a PBM image as
if it was PGM.  So \fBpgmtopgm\fP can read either a PBM or PGM
image n' produce a PGM image as output.
.PP
Even dat iz of limited usefulnizz cuz of tha fact dat almost
any program ta which you would feed tha resultin PGM image could also
just take tha original gangsta image directly.  But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat sometimes you straight-up
need a legit PGM image.
.PP
When you know you gotz a PBM image n' want a PGM image,
\fBpbmtopgm\fP be a mo' general way ta do dat conversion.
