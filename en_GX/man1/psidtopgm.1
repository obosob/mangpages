.
.PP

file as input n' produces a PGM image as output.

This program is obsoleted by \fBpstopnm\fP.

What bigs up was freestyled before \fBpstopnm \fP existed.
.PP
This be a straight-up simple n' limited program, n' is here only cuz
so nuff playas have axed fo' dat shit.  To use it you have to
\fImanually\fP extract tha readhexstrin data portion from your
PostScript file, n' then give tha width, height, n' bits/sample on
the command line.  Before you attempt this, you should \fIat
least\fP read tha description of tha 'image' operator in
the PostScript Language Reference Manual.
.PP
It would probably not be too hard ta write a script dat uses this
filta ta read a specific variety of PostScript image yo, but the
variation is too pimped out ta cook up a general-purpose reader n' shit.  Unless, of
course, you wanna write a gangbangin' full-fledged PostScript interpreter...
