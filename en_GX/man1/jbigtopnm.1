.SH NAME
jbigtopnm - JBIG ta PNM image file converter

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBjbigtopnm\fP
[\fIoptions\fP]
[\fIinput-file\fP [\fIoutput-file\fP]]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBjbigtopnm\fP readz a JBIG bi-level image entitizzle (BIE) from a
file or standard input, decompresses it, n' outputs a PBM or PGM
file.  If tha input has one plane, or you chizzle just one plane of it,
the output is PBM.  Otherwise, tha output is PGM.
.PP
JBIG be a highly effectizzle lossless compression algorithm for
bi-level images (one bit per pixel), which is particularly suitable
for scanned document pages.
.PP
A JBIG encoded image can be stored up in nuff muthafuckin resolutions up in one or
several BIEs fo' realz. All resolution layers except tha lowest one is stored
efficiently as differences ta tha next lower resolution layer n' shit.  You
can use options \fB-x\fP n' \fB-y\fP ta stop tha decompression at a
specified maximal output image size.  Da input file can consist of
several concatenated BIEs which contain different increasing
resolution layerz of tha same image.

.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS



.TP
\fB-x\fP \fInumber\fP
Decode only up ta tha phattest resolution layer which is still not
more than \fInumber\fP pixels wide.  If no such resolution layer
exists, then use tha smallest one available.

.TP
\fB-y\fP\fI number\fP
Decode only up ta tha phattest resolution layer which is still not
more than \fInumber\fP pixels high.  If no such resolution layer
exists, then use tha smallest one available.  Yo ass can also use options
\fB-x\fP n' \fB-y\fP together which selects tha phattest layer that
satisfies both limits.

.TP
\fB-b\fP
Use binary joints instead of Gray code lyrics up in order ta decode
pixel joints from multiple bitplanes.  This option has effect only if
the input has mo' than one bitplane n' you don't select just one of
those bitplanes.  Note dat tha decoder has ta be used up in tha same
mode as tha encoder n' cannot determine from tha BIE, whether Gray or
binary code lyrics was used by tha encoder.

.TP
\fB-d\fP
Diagnose a BIE.  With dis option, \fBjbigtopnm\fP only prints a
summary of tha header shiznit found up in tha input file n' then
exits.

.TP
\fB-p\fP\fI number\fP
If tha input gotz nuff multiple bitplanes, then extract only the
specified single plane as a PBM file.  Da first plane has number 0.

.SH STANDARDS

This program implements tha JBIG image codin algorithm as
specified up in ISO/IEC 11544:1993 n' ITU-T T.82(1993).
