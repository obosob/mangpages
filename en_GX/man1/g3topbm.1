Minimum unique abbreviation of option be acceptable.  Yo ass may use double

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBg3topbm\fP readz a Group 3 fax file wit MH (Modified Huffman)
compression as input n' produces a PBM image as output.
.PP
\fBg3topbm\fP tolerates various deviations from tha standard,
so as ta recover a shitload of tha image if there was a transmission error.
One thang it tolerates is linez of varyin length.  Da standard requires
all tha lines ta be tha same length; \fBg3topbm\fP make tha output
image as wide as tha longest line up in tha input n' padz tha others on
the right.  It warns you when it do all dis bullshit.
.PP
Yo ass can use tha \fBstop_error\fP option ta make \fBg3topbm\fP
insist on valid input.
.PP
There is no Netpbm program dat understandz tha other G3 fax
compression methods: MR (Modified Read) n' MMR (Modified Modified Read).
.PP
Note dat tha Group 3 fax file format do not include any kind of a
signature so dat \fBg3topbm\fP might verify itz straight-up lookin at a G3
file or dat tha compression method is MH.  Da program will interpret any
sequence of bytes you give it as if it is G3 and, while typically issuin a
lot of error lyrics bout tha file not conformin ta tha G3 MH format, will
produce output (unless you use
\fB-stoperror\fP).  In particular, if you feed \fBg3topbm\fP a MR or MMR
file, it aint gonna rap  of yo' mistake.
.PP
There is subformatz of TIFF dat use tha Group 3 fax encodings
inside.  See \fBtifftopnm\fP.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-kludge\fP
Tells \fBg3topbm\fP ta ignore tha straight-up original gangsta few linez of tha file;
sometimes fax filez have some junk all up in tha beginning.

.TP
\fB-reversebits\fP
Tells \fBg3topbm\fP ta interpret bits least-significant first,
instead of tha default most-significant first.  Apparently some fax
modems do it one way n' others do it tha other way.  If you git a
whole bunch of 'bad code word' lyrics, try rockin this
option.

.TP
\fB-stretch\fP
This option  drops some lyrics ta \fBg3topbm\fP ta stretch tha image vertically by
duplicatin each row.  This is fo' tha low-qualitizzle transmission mode.

.TP
\fB-width=\fP\fIpixels\fP
This option  drops some lyrics ta \fBg3topbm\fP dat tha image is supposed ta be
\fIpixels\fP pixels wide.  If any line up in it aint dat size, \fBg3topbm\fP
issues a warnin or fails, dependin on whether you specify
\fB-stop_error\fP.
.sp
Yo ass cannot specify both \fB-width\fP n' \fB-paper_size\fP.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.33 (March 2006).

.TP
\fB-paper_size=\fP{\fBA3\fP,\fBA4\fP,\fBA5\fP,\fBA6\fP,\fBB4\fP}
This option  drops some lyrics ta \fBg3topbm\fP fo' what tha fuck size paper dis image is
supposed ta be formatted. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time.  \fBg3topbm\fP uses tha width of tha paper
the same way as wit tha \fB-width\fP option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  \fBg3topbm\fP
does not use tha height of tha paper fo' anything.
.sp
Yo ass cannot specify both \fB-width\fP n' \fB-paper_size\fP.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.33 (March 2006).

.TP
\fB-stop_error\fP
This option  drops some lyrics ta \fBg3topbm\fP ta fail when it findz a problem
in tha input.  'Fail' means it terminates wit a nonzero
status code wit tha contentz of tha output file undefined.
.sp
If you don't specify dis option, \fBg3topbm\fP do its dopest to
work round input errors n' salvage as much of tha image as possible
in tha output image.  It first tries ta resynchronize ta a lata line
by searchin fo' tha next End Of Line marker, skippin any lines or
partial lines up in between. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  It saves tha beginnin of tha line up in which
it encountered tha problem.  If tha input file endz prematurely,
\fBg3topbm\fP produces output containin tha lines up ta where it
encountered tha problem.
.sp
\fBg3topbm\fP thangs warnin lyrics when it continues up in spite of
input errors.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.24 (August 2004).  Before that,
\fBg3topbm\fP always failed when it encountered premature EOF and
never failed when it encountered other problems.
