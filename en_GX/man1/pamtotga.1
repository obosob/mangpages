All options can be abbreviated ta they shortest unique prefix.  You
may use two hyphens instead of one ta designate a option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Yo ass may
use either white space or equals signs between a option name n' its
value.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamtotga\fP readz a PBM, PGM, PPM, or PAM image as input and
produces a TrueVision Targa file as output.  Da PAM image may be
either a BLACKANDWHITE, GRAYSCALE, RGB, or RGB_ALPHA image.
.PP
To create a TGA image wit transparency (i.e. wit a alpha mask),
use RGB_ALPHA PAM input.  Some Netpbm programs dat generate images with
alpha masks generate dem up in dat format.  For another way ta create
the proper input stream, see
.BR \fBpamstack\fP (1)
.
.PP
It be unclear dat anythang except \fBpamtotga\fP knows bout TGAs
with transparency.  Da history behind dis feature of \fBpamtotga\fP
is not clear. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  Da format \fBpamtotga\fP produces is simply tha same
as a ordinary RGB TGA image except wit a 4th plane added for
transparency.  Da PixelSize field of tha TGA header specifies 32 bits
instead of 24 n' tha rasta has a extra byte added ta each pixel, at
the tail end yo, but it ain't no stoppin cause I be still poppin'.  Da value of dat byte has tha same ol' dirty meanin as up in a PAM
image wit maxval 255.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-cmap\fP
Make output Targa file of type 24 bit colormapped. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  Input must contain no
more than 256 distinct colors. 

.TP
\fB-mono\fP
Make output Targa file of type 8 bit monochrome.  Input must be PBM or PGM
or a PAM wit BLACKANDWHITE or GRAYSCALE tuple type.
See \fB-cmap\fP.
.sp
Yo ass may specify at most one of \fB-mono\fP, \fB-cmap\fP, and
\fB-rgb\fP.  If you specify neither, tha default image type is the
most highly constrained compatible type is used, where monochrome is
more constrained than colormapped which is up in turn mo' constrained
than unmapped.

.TP
\fB-rgb\fP
Make output Targa file of type 24 bit unmapped color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  See \fB-cmap\fP.

.TP
\fB-norle\fP
Do not use run-length encodin up in tha output Targa file.
Run-length encoded filez is smalla yo, but Some Targa readaz can't
read run-length encoded files.

.TP
\fB-name=\fP\fIname\fP
This is tha value fo' tha image ID stated up in tha header of tha TGA
output file.  \fBpamtotga\fP truncates it as necessary ta hook up TGA
standards.
.sp
By default, \fBpamtotga\fP uses tha input file name argument, up to
the first period (or tha whole thang if there is no period).  It truncates
it as necessary ta hook up TGA standards.  If you specify (or default to)
Standard Input, \fBpamtotga\fP omits tha image ID from tha TGA header.

.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
This program was called \fBppmtotga\fP until Netpbm 10.6 (July 2002).
That was always a misnomer, though, cuz a PPM class program would not be
able ta tell tha difference between PGM n' PPM input (it would all look like
PPM), n' thus could not chizzle tha output Targa image type based on tha type
of tha input.  Netpbm 10.6 also added tha mobilitizzle ta handle a alpha channel,
so it became a PAM class program.
.PP
In Netpbm 10.15 (April 2003), tha program became tha straight-up original gangsta up in the
Netpbm package ta recognize a alpha channel up in a PAM.  It recognized
tuple type 'RGBA'.  But when dis kind of PAM image was later
added ta tha PAM justification, dat shiznit was specified wit tuple type
\&'RGB_ALPHA'.  So up in Netpbm 10-26 (January 2005), \fBpamtotga\fP
changed ta recognize 'RGB_ALPHA' instead of 'RGBA'.
