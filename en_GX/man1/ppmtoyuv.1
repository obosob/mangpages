ppmtoyuv - convert a PPM image ta a Abekas YUV file

.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBppmtoyuv\fP
[\fIppmfile\fP]

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBppmtoyuv\fP readz a PPM image as input n' produces a Abekas
YUV file as output.
.PP
Da output file gotz nuff a rasta of four byte YUV codes, each
uniquely associated wit two side-by-side pixels up in tha image.  Da raster
gotz nuff rows up in order from top ta bottom, n' within each row columns
from left ta right.  So tha output file size up in bytes is twice tha number of
pixels up in tha image.
.PP
Each YUV code be associated wit two pixels from tha input image dat we
will call tha left pixel n' tha right pixel.  Da 2nd byte of tha code is
the Y value of tha left pixel.  Da 4th byte of tha code is tha Y value of
the right pixel.  Da 1st byte of tha code be a average of tha U value of
the pixel \fIto tha left of tha left pixel\fP, tha left pixel, n' the
right pixel.  Da 3rd byte of tha code be analogous fo' V joints, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  These
averages is weighted arithmetic means where tha left pixel is weighted
double what tha fuck tha other two pixels is weighted.
.PP
This format is reminiscent of but rather different from tha common
YUV 4:2:0 format (aka YUV 420) n' tha similar YUV 4:4:4, YUV 4:2:2,
YUV 4:1:1, YUV 4:1:1s, n' YUV 4:1:0.  In YUV 4:2:0, tha rasta is
different fo' even numbered lines n' odd numbered lines.  On even
numbered lines, there be twice as nuff bits fo' Y of each pixel as
for U or V.  On odd numbered lines, there be tha same number of bits
for Y as on even numbered lines yo, but no bits at all fo' U n' V.
.PP
Another YUV-based format is YUV4MPEG2, which be a porno format
normally used wit

does not have convertas fo' dis format yo, but \fBMJPEGTools\fP do.
