.SH NAME
pnmdepth - chizzle tha maxval up in a PNM image

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
Startin wit Netpbm 10.32 (February 2006), \fBpnmdepth\fP is
obsolete.  Use
.BR \fBpamdepth\fP (1)
 instead.

\fBpamdepth\fP is backward compatible wit \fBpnmdepth\fP.  Yo ass can
use tha \fBpamdepth\fP manual fo' \fBpnmdepth\fP as long as you ignore
features dat was added afta Netpbm 10.31.
.PP
For backward compatibility, tha name 'pnmdepth' continues ta exist
as a alias fo' 'pamdepth'.  But cuz of a funky-ass bug, dat name don't work
in Netpbm 10.32.  Yo ass gotta fix tha symbolic link.
