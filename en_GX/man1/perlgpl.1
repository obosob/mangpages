\&
\&  Everyone is permitted ta copy n' distribute verbatim copies
\&  of dis license document yo, but changin it aint allowed.
\&
\&                            Preamble
\&
\&   Da license agreementz of most software g-units try ta keep users
\& all up in tha mercy of dem g-units, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  By contrast, our General Public
\& License is intended ta guarantee yo' freedom ta share n' chizzle free
\& software\-\-to make shizzle tha software is free fo' all its users.  The
\& General Public License applies ta tha Jacked Software Foundation\*(Aqs
\& software n' ta any other program whose authors commit ta rockin dat shit.
\& Yo ass can use it fo' yo' programs, like a muthafucka.
\&
\&   When we drop a rhyme of free software, we is referrin ta freedom, not
\& price.  Specifically, tha General Public License is designed ta make
\& shizzle dat you have tha freedom ta give away or push copiez of free
\& software, dat you receive source code or can git it if you want it,
\& dat you can chizzle tha software or use piecez of it up in freshly smoked up free
\& programs; n' dat you know you can do these thangs.
\&
\&   To protect yo' rights, we need ta make restrictions dat forbid
\& mah playas ta deny you these muthafuckin rights or ta ask you ta surrender tha rights.
\& These restrictions translate ta certain responsibilitizzles fo' you if you
\& distribute copiez of tha software, or if you modify dat shit.
\&
\&   For example, if you distribute copiez of a such a program, whether
\& gratis or fo' a gangbangin' fee, you must give tha recipients all tha muthafuckin rights that
\& you have.  Yo ass must make shizzle dat they, too, receive or can git the
\& source code.  And you must tell dem they rights.
\&
\&   We protect yo' muthafuckin rights wit two steps: (1) copyright tha software, and
\& (2) offer you dis license which gives you legal permission ta copy,
\& distribute and/or modify tha software.
\&
\&   Also, fo' each author\*(Aqs protection n' ours, we wanna make certain
\& dat mah playas understandz dat there is no warranty fo' dis free
\& software.  If tha software is modified by one of mah thugs n' passed on, we
\& want its recipients ta know dat what tha fuck they have aint tha original, so
\& dat any problems introduced by others aint gonna reflect on tha original
\& authors\*(Aq reputations.
\&
\&   Da precise terms n' conditions fo' copying, distribution and
\& modification follow.
\&
\&                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
\&    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
\&
\&   0. This License Agreement applies ta any program or other work which
\& gotz nuff a notice placed by tha copyright holda sayin it may be
\& distributed under tha termz of dis General Public License.  The
\& "Program", below, refers ta any such program or work, n' a "work based
\& on tha Program" means either tha Program or any work containin the
\& Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or wit modifications.  Each
\& licensee be addressed as "you".
\&
\&   1. Yo ass may copy n' distribute verbatim copiez of tha Program\*(Aqs source
\& code as you receive it, up in any medium, provided dat you conspicuously and
\& appropriately publish on each copy a appropriate copyright notice and
\& disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all tha notices dat refer ta this
\& General Public License n' ta tha absence of any warranty; n' give any
\& other recipientz of tha Program a cold-ass lil copy of dis General Public License
\& along wit tha Program.  Yo ass may charge a gangbangin' fee fo' tha physical act of
\& transferrin a cold-ass lil copy.
\&
\&   2. Yo ass may modify yo' copy or copiez of tha Program or any portion of
\& it, n' copy n' distribute such modifications under tha termz of Paragraph
\& 1 above, provided dat you also do tha following:
\&
\&     a) cause tha modified filez ta carry prominent notices statin that
\&     you chizzled tha filez n' tha date of any chizzle; and
\&
\&     b) cause tha whole of any work dat you distribute or publish, that
\&     up in whole or up in part gotz nuff tha Program or any part thereof, either
\&     wit or without modifications, ta be licensed at no charge ta all
\&     third partizzles under tha termz of dis General Public License (except
\&     dat you may chizzle ta grant warranty protection ta some or all
\&     third parties, at yo' option).
\&
\&     c) If tha modified program normally readz commandz interactively when
\&     run, you must cause it, when started hustlin fo' such interactizzle use
\&     up in tha simplest n' most usual way, ta print or display an
\&     announcement includin a appropriate copyright notice n' a notice
\&     dat there is no warranty (or else, sayin dat you provide a
\&     warranty) n' dat playas may redistribute tha program under these
\&     conditions, n' spittin some lyrics ta tha user how tha fuck ta view a cold-ass lil copy of dis General
\&     Public License.
\&
\&     d) Yo ass may charge a gangbangin' fee fo' tha physical act of transferrin a
\&     copy, n' you may at yo' option offer warranty protection in
\&     exchange fo' a gangbangin' fee.
\&
\& Mere aggregation of another independent work wit tha Program (or its
\& derivative) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium do not brang
\& tha other work under tha scope of these terms.
\&
\&   3. Yo ass may copy n' distribute tha Program (or a portion or derivatizzle of
\& it, under Paragraph 2) up in object code or executable form under tha terms of
\& Paragraphs 1 n' 2 above provided dat you also do one of tha following:
\&
\&     a) accompany it wit tha complete correspondin machine\-readable
\&     source code, which must be distributed under tha terms of
\&     Paragraphs 1 n' 2 above; or,
\&
\&     b) accompany it wit a gangbangin' freestyled offer, valid fo' at least three
\&     years, ta give any third jam free (except fo' a nominal charge
\&     fo' tha cost of distribution) a cold-ass lil complete machine\-readable copy of the
\&     correspondin source code, ta be distributed under tha terms of
\&     Paragraphs 1 n' 2 above; or,
\&
\&     c) accompany it wit tha shiznit you received as ta where the
\&     correspondin source code may be obtained. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  (This alternatizzle is
\&     allowed only fo' noncommercial distribution n' only if you
\&     received tha program up in object code or executable form ridin' solo.)
\&
\& Source code fo' a work means tha preferred form of tha work fo' making
\& modifications ta dat shit.  For a executable file, complete source code means
\& all tha source code fo' all modulez it gotz nuff; but, as a special
\& exception, it need not include source code fo' modulez which is standard
\& libraries dat accompany tha operatin system on which tha executable
\& file runs, or fo' standard header filez or definitions filez that
\& accompany dat operatin system.
\&
\&   4. Yo ass may not copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer the
\& Program except as expressly provided under dis General Public License.
\& Any attempt otherwise ta copy, modify, sublicense, distribute or transfer
\& tha Program is void, n' will automatically terminizzle yo' muthafuckin rights ta use
\& tha Program under dis License.  But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat partizzles whoz ass have received
\& copies, or muthafuckin rights ta use copies, from you under dis General Public
\& License aint gonna have they licenses terminated so long as such parties
\& remain up in full compliance.
\&
\&   5. By copying, distributin or modifyin tha Program (or any work based
\& on tha Program) you indicate yo' acceptizzle of dis license ta do so,
\& n' all its terms n' conditions.
\&
\&   6. Each time you redistribute tha Program (or any work based on the
\& Program), tha recipient automatically receives a license from tha original
\& licensor ta copy, distribute or modify tha Program subject ta these
\& terms n' conditions.  Yo ass may not impose any further restrictions on the
\& recipients\*(Aq exercise of tha muthafuckin rights granted herein.
\&
\&   7. Da Jacked Software Foundation may publish revised and/or freshly smoked up versions
\& of tha General Public License from time ta time.  Such freshly smoked up versions will
\& be similar up in spirit ta tha present version yo, but may differ up in detail to
\& address freshly smoked up problems or concerns.
\&
\& Each version is given a gangbangin' finger-lickin' distinguishin version number n' shit.  If tha Program
\& specifies a version number of tha license which applies ta it n' "any
\& lata version", you have tha option of followin tha terms n' conditions
\& either of dat version or of any lata version published by tha Free
\& Software Foundation. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  If tha Program do not specify a version number of
\& tha license, you may chizzle any version eva published by tha Jacked Software
\& Foundation.
\&
\&   8. If you wish ta incorporate partz of tha Program tha fuck into other free
\& programs whose distribution conditions is different, write ta tha author
\& ta ask fo' permission. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  For software which is copyrighted by tha Free
\& Software Foundation, write ta tha Jacked Software Foundation; we sometimes
\& make exceptions fo' all dis bullshit.  Our decision is ghon be guided by tha two goals
\& of preservin tha free statuz of all derivativez of our free software and
\& of biggin' up tha pluggin n' reuse of software generally.
\&
\&                            NO WARRANTY
\&
\&   9. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
\& FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
\& OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
\& PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
\& OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
\& MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
\& TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
\& PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
\& REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
\&
\&   10. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
\& WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
\& REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
\& INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
\& OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
\& TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
\& YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
\& PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
\& POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

\&                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
\&
\&        Appendix: How tha fuck ta Apply These Terms ta Yo crazy-ass New Programs
\&
\&   If you pimp a freshly smoked up program, n' you want it ta be of tha top billin
\& possible use ta humanity, tha dopest way ta bust dis is ta make it
\& free software which mah playas can redistribute n' chizzle under these
\& terms.
\&
\&   To do so, attach tha followin notices ta tha program.  It be safest to
\& attach dem ta tha start of each source file ta most effectively convey
\& tha exclusion of warranty; n' each file should have at least the
\& "copyright" line n' a pointa ta where tha full notice is found.

\&     02110\-1301 USA
\&
\&
\& Also add shiznit on how tha fuck ta contact you by electronic n' paper mail.
\&
