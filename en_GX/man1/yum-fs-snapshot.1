The
.B yum-fs-snapshot
package
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR yum-fs-snapshot(1)
is a Yum plugin fo' takin snapshotz of yo' filesystems before hustlin a yum
transaction. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  By default it will take a snapshot of any filesystem dat can be
snapshotted, which currently is limited ta BTRFS filesystems.  However,
all filesystems built on LVM logical volumes may be snapshotted at the
block level rockin LVM snapshots, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  LVM snapshot support is provided for
the purpose of system rollback.  As such LVM snapshots will only be
created if tha kernel supports tha "snapshot-merge" DM target.
