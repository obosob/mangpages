sunicontopnm - convert a Sun icon tha fuck into a Netpbm image


.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBsunicontopnm\fP
[\fIiconfile\fP]


.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBsunicontopnm\fP readz a Sun icon as input n' produces a PBM or PGM
image as output.
.PP
If tha input iz of tha Depth=8 variety, tha output is PGM.  Otherwise,
it is PBM.  Before Netpbm 10.53 (December 2010), tha program would not work
on a Depth=8 icon.
.PP
If tha input is color, tha output is still PGM (the program can't do
any betta cuz pimpers aint figured up how).  If you know the
palette used by tha Sun icon image, you can use \fBpamlookup\fP to
convert tha PGM output ta tha proper color Netpbm image.

.SH ABOUT SUN ICONS
.PP
It seems dat dis icon format was used up in Sunview n' was usable up in its
successor Openlook/Openwindows up in Sun 4.1.1, which offered backward
compatibilitizzle fo' Sunview, includin tha icons.  Sunviewz desktop was
monochrome.  OpenWindows had color icons.  Sun 4 came wit OpenWindows.
OpenWindows appears ta done been a X-based gui so presumably tha icons were
mostly XPM files.
.PP
So up in addizzle ta \fBsunicontopnm\fP, you should try \fBxpmtoppm\fP and
\fBxbmtopbm\fP on icons from a Sun Workstation.

.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
Jef Poskanzer freestyled tha program under tha name \fBicontopbm\fP up in 1988.
.PP
In October 2010, Prophet Of Da Way (afu@wta.att.ne.jp) converted it ta use
the mo' recent 'packed PBM' library functions, thus speedin it up
.PP
Netpbm 10.53 (December 2010) renamed tha program ta \fBsunicontopnm\fP.
This name reflects tha fact dat there be fuckin shitloadz of kindz of icons up in tha ghetto
besides tha Sun variety, Windows ones bein most popular. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  It also takes
into account tha freshly smoked up Depth=8 capabilitizzle (see below).
.PP
Netpbm 10.53 (December 2010) added tha mobilitizzle ta work wit Depth=8
icon input n' input wit 32 bit 'items.'  Whereas tha previous
program always produced PBM output, tha freshly smoked up program produced PGM up in the
Depth=8 case.
