.
.PP
\fBpbmpage\fP generates a one page test pattern ta print on a
shizzle of paper, fo' use up in calibratin a printer n' shit.  Da test pattern in

If yo ass is printin on a HP PPA printer, you can convert the
output of dis program ta a stream dat you can feed ta tha printer
with \fBpbmtoppa\fP.

Bear up in mind dat when you print tha test pattern, yo ass is testin not
only tha printer yo, but any converta or driver software along the
printin path.  Any one of these components may adjust margins, crop
the image, erase edges, n' such.

If, cuz of addizzle of margins, tha printa refuses ta print the
image cuz it is too big, use \fBpamcut\fP ta cut tha right and
bottom edges off tha test pattern until it is lil' small-ass enough ta print.

as bigs up.  Da default is \fB1\fP.
