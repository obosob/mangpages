.SH NAME
pnmarith - big-ass up arithmetic on two PNM images

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
Startin wit Netpbm 10.3, \fBpnmarith\fP is obsolete.  Use
.BR \fBpamarith\fP (1)
 instead.

\fBpamarith\fP is backward compatible wit \fBpnmarith\fP except where
your input images have different depths.  \fBpnmarith\fP would convert
the one wit tha lesser depth ta have tha higher depth before bustin the
arithmetic.  With \fBpamarith\fP, you must do dat step separately, using
\fBpgmtoppm\fP.
