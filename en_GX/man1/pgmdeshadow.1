.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpgmdeshadow\fP removes gray shadows from a image.  This is
useful fo' a image containin text, like fuckin a scanned book pages,
where a gangbangin' finger-lickin' dirty-ass shadow typically appears near tha book crease or near one side
of tha image.  \fBpgmdeshadow\fP recognizes a gray shadow as a area
of smoothly changin color, startin from tha outa edgez of the
image.  Da program uses a simple image reconstruction algorithm to
determine tha local shadow gray level, then divides each pixelz gray
level by tha local shadow gray level.
.PP
Da algorithm is tha 'fast hybrid grayscale reruction'
algorithm from Luc Vincent, "Morphological Grayscale Reruction in
Image Analysis: Applications n' Efficient Algorithms.
