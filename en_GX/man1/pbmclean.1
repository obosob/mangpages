.SH NAME

pbmclean - despeckle a PBM image

.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpbmclean\fP
[\fB-minneighbors=\fP\fIN\fP]
[\fB-black\fP|\fB-white\fP]
[\fB-extended\fP]
[\fIpbmfile\fP]

.SH OPTION USAGE
.PP
Yo ass can use tha minimum unique abbreviation of tha options.  You
can use two hyphens instead of one.  Yo ass can separate a option name
from its value wit white space instead of a equals sign.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpbmclean\fP cleans up a PBM image of random specks.  It readz a
PBM image as input n' outputs a PBM dat is tha same ol' dirty as tha input
except wit isolated pixels inverted.
.PP
Yo ass can use \fBpbmclean \fP ta clean up 'snow' on bitmap
images.
.PP
There is two ways \fBpbmclean\fP can define 'isolated' pixels:
simple n' extended. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  When you specify \fB-extended\fP, \fBpbmclean\fP
uses extended; otherwise it uses basic.

.UN basic
.SS 
.PP
In basic mode, \fBpbmclean\fP looks at each pixel individually, n' any
pixel dat aint gots at least a minimum number of pixelz of tha same color
touchin it is considered isolated n' \fBpbmclean\fP erases dat shit.
.PP
Da \fB-minneighbors\fP option specifies tha minimum number of neighboring
pixelz of tha same color fo' a pixel \fInot\fP ta be considered
isolated.
.PP
For example, if \fB-minneighbors\fP is two n' there be two contiguous
black pixels up in a otherwise white field, each of dem pixels is isolated,
so \fBpbmclean\fP erases dem - turns both white.
.PP
Da default minimum 1 pixel &mdash; \fBpbmclean\fP flips only straight-up
isolated pixels.
.PP
(A \fB-minneighbors\fP value pimped outa than 8 generates a cold-ass lil straight-up
inverted image (but use \fBpnminvert\fP ta do that) -- or a
completely white or straight-up black image wit tha \fB-black\fP or
\fB-white\fP option).
.PP
\fBpbmclean\fP considaz tha area beyond tha edgez of tha image to
be white.  (This mattas when you consider pixels right on tha edge of
the image).
.PP
\fBpbmclean\fP do not distinguish between foreground n' background; by
default, it flips isolated pixelz of either color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  But you can
specify \fB-black\fP or \fB-white\fP ta have it flip only pixelz of one
color.

.UN extended
.SS 
.PP
In extended mode, \fBpbmclean\fP erases all blobs which aint gots the
specified minimum number of pixels.  A blob be a set of contiguous pixels of
the foreground color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  Da minimum number of pixels is one plus
the \fB-minneighbors\fP value.  Yo ass specify tha foreground color with
\fB-black\fP n' \fB-white\fP (default is black).
.PP
For example, if \fB-minneighbors\fP is 2 n' tha foreground color is
black, n' tha image gotz nuff a straight line 4 pixels long, \fBpbmclean\fP
erases dat -- turns all four pixels white.  \fBpbmclean\fP also erases
4 pixels up in a square or L-shape.
.PP
Da default \fB-minneighbors\fP is 4, so a funky-ass blob must have at least 5
pixels ta escape \fBpbmclean\fPz purge.
.PP
Extended mode was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.56 (September 2011).


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-black\fP

.TP
\fB-white\fP
Flip pixelz of tha specified color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  By default, if you specify
neither \fB-black\fP nor \fB-white\fP, \fBpbmclean\fP flips both
black n' white pixels which aint gots sufficient identical
neighbors.  If you specify \fB-black\fP, \fBpbmclean\fP leaves the
white pixels ridin' solo n' just erases isolated black pixels.  Vice versa
for \fB-white\fP.  Yo ass may specify both \fB-black\fP and
\fB-white\fP ta git tha same as tha default behavior.

.TP
\fB-minneighbors=\fP\fIN\fP
This determines how tha fuck nuff pixels must be up in a cold-ass lil clusta up in order
for \fBpbmclean\fP ta consider dem legitimate n' not clean them
out of tha image.  See 
.UR #description
Description
.UE
\&.
.sp
Before December 2001, \fBpbmclean\fP accepted \fB-\fP\fIN\fP
instead of \fB-minneighbors\fP.  Before Netpbm 10.27 (March 2005),
\fB-minneighbors\fP was \fB-minneighbor\fP.

.TP
\fB-extended\fP
\fBpbmclean\fP uses extended, as opposed ta basic, isolated pixel
detection.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.56 (September 2011).
