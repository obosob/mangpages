.TH "Fax Formats" 1 "03 December 2008" "netpbm documentation"

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
This page, part of the
.BR Netpbm userz guide (1)
,
raps bout FAX formats up in relation ta Netpbm facilities.


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Da ITU (formerly CCITT) publishes standardz fo' operation of fax machines
(the scam is ta provide a way ta be shizzle dat a gangbangin' fax machine be able ta receive
a fax busted by another).  These standardz incidentally specify graphics file
formats -- a protocol fo' representin a visual image up in sequencez of bits.
.PP
Da two relevant standardz is called Group 3 (G3) n' Group 4 (G4) (Groups
1 n' 2 is analog standardz no longer up in use).  Virtually every last muthafuckin fax machine
in existence conforms at least generally ta at least one of these standards.
.PP
Da standard fo' Group 3 fax is defined up in ITU Recommendation T.4.  In the
U.S., dat is implemented by EIA standardz EIA-465 n' EIA-466.  These
standardz cover mo' than tha file format as well, includin how tha fuck ta transmit
bits over a telephone line n' procedures fo' handlin document transmissions.
.PP
G3 faxes is 204 dots per inch (dpi) horizontally n' 98 dpi (196
dpi optionally, up in fine-detail mode) vertically.
.PP
Da standardz specify three file formats (also called codin methodz and
compression schemes -- remember tha standard don't mention computa files;
it talks bout tha format of a stream of bits pimpin' over a telephone
line):



.TP
MH
This compresses up in one dimension: it compresses individual rasta lines
but make no attempt ta compress redundancy between lines.
.sp
One dimensionizzle compression is traditionally tha dopest a gangbangin' fax machine could
handle cuz G3 neither assumes error free transmission not retransmits when
errors occur, n' receivin fax machines traditionally could not afford to
buffer much of a page.  It aint nuthin but blingin dat when there be a error up in a raster
line, its impact not spread ta nuff lines afta dat shit.
.sp
All Group 3 n' Group 4 fax machines must be able ta bust n' receive MH.
.sp
MH is sometimes called 'G3,' but dat be a skanky name cuz
while tha Group 3 standard do specify MH, it has always specified other
formats like a muthafucka.
.sp
MH is sometimes called 'T4' based on tha name of the
document dat specifies it, ITU T.4.  But dis be a skanky name cuz
T.4 also specifies MR.


.TP
MR
This compresses up in two dimensions, horizontally n' vertically.
.sp
MR has always been part of tha Group 3 standard yo, but is optional
(a Group 3 fax machine may or may not be able ta bust n' receive it).

.TP
MMR
This be a mo' advanced format than tha others.  It be even more
two-dimensionizzle than MR.  It be optionizzle up in tha Group 3 standard, n' didn't
even exist up in earlier versionz of dat shit.  Dat shiznit was pimped specifically fo' the
Group 4 standard yo, but then added ta a extended Group 3 standard as well.
.sp
MMR is sometimes called Group 4 yo, but dat be a skanky name cuz of
the fact dat it be also part of tha current Group 3 standard.
.sp
MMR is sometimes called 'T6' based on tha name of tha document
 dat specifies it, ITU T.6.


.PP
\fBg3topbm\fP converts tha MH format ta PBM.  \fBpbmtog3\fP converts
PBM ta MH.
.PP
There is no Netpbm program ta convert ta or from other fax formats.

.SH TIFF
.PP
Da TIFF format is flexible enough ta allow fuckin shitloadz of different coding
methods, within dat shit.  There is TIFF subformats fo' MH, MR, n' MMR, among
others.  These is particularly useful when you receive a gangbangin' fax as a TIFF file.
.PP
\fBtifftopnm\fP recognizes n' can convert from any of these.
.PP
\fBpamtotiff\fP can convert ta any of these; you use command options
to chizzle which.
