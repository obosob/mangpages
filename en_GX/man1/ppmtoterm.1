.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
. 
.PP
This program tries ta produce a accurate representation of a PPM
image on a terminal dat implements tha ANSI ISO 6429 standard. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  It
approximates colors, findin tha minimum Cartesian distizzle between the
input RGB vectors n' tha ones up in tha generated palette.  As the
available color palette is somewhat restricted, you git tha best
results when tha flavas up in tha original gangsta image is few n' tha RGB
intensitizzles is close ta zero, half of maximum, n' maximum.
.PP
Yo ass can probably git phat thangs up in dis biatch wit cartoons or images with
plain flavas (no gradients).  With photos, thangs up in dis biatch can vary yo, but are
usually not straight-up accurate.
.PP
Da output image has one line fo' each row n' one characta fo' each
column of tha input image.  E.g. a 80 pixel by 25 pixel PPM image would
fill up a 80x25 terminal screen. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Use \fBpamscale\fP or \fBpamcut\fP
to make yo' image fit properly on yo' screen.
.PP
Furthermore, use \fBpamscale\fP ta recover tha proper aspect ratio,
because a cold-ass lil characta on a terminal screen is rarely square.  Typically, a
characta is twice has high as it is wide, so up in order fo' a 20x20 image to
appear square on yo' terminal, as it should, you gonna wanna squash it
vertically or stretch it horizontally by a gangbangin' factor of two (resultin int 10x20
charactas is 20x40 characters).
.PP
Da image starts all up in tha current cursor posizzle on tha terminal
screen. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Each successive row starts at Column 0 on tha screen. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  If you want
to shift tha image up or down, fo' example ta centa it, use
\fBpnmpad\fP on tha input.
.PP
This program started doin thangs wit tha objectizzle of displayin sick color
images on tha Linux console, e.g. a proper logo at Linux boot.
.PP
\fBpbmto4425\fP do a similar thang fo' black n' white images, using
line drawin characters, on some terminals.
