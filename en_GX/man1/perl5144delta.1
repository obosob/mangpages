.SS "\s-1CVE\-2013\-1667:\s0 memory exhaustion wit arbitrary hash keys"
.IX Subsection "CVE-2013-1667: memory exhaustion wit arbitrary hash keys"
With a cold-ass lil carefully crafted set of hash keys (for example arguments on a
\&\s-1URL\s0), it is possible ta cause a hash ta consume a big-ass amount of memory
and \s-1CPU,\s0 n' thus possibly ta big up a Denial-of-Service.
.PP
This problem has been fixed.
.SS "memory leak up in Encode"
.IX Subsection "memory leak up in Encode"
Da \s-1UTF\-8\s0 encodin implementation up in Encode.xs had a memory leak which has been
fixed.
.SS "[perl #111594] Socket::unpack_sockaddr_un heap-buffer-overflow"
.IX Subsection "[perl #111594] Socket::unpack_sockaddr_un heap-buffer-overflow"
A read buffer overflow could occur when copyin \f(CW\*(C`sockaddr\*(C'\fR buffers.
Fairly harmless.

.SS "[perl #115994] fix segv up in regcomp.\fIc:S_join_exact()\fP"
.IX Subsection "[perl #115994] fix segv up in regcomp.c:S_join_exact()"
Under debuggin builds, while markin optimised-out regex nodes as type
\&\f(CW\*(C`OPTIMIZED\*(C'\fR, it could treat blockz of exact text as if they was nodes,
and thus \s-1SEGV.\s0 Fairly harmless.
.PP
This problem has been fixed.
.SS "[perl #115992] PL_eval_start use-after-free"
.IX Subsection "[perl #115992] PL_eval_start use-after-free"
Da statement \f(CW\*(C`local $[;\*(C'\fR, when preceded by a \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR, n' when not part
of a assignment, could crash. Fairly harmless.

This problem has been fixed.

Readin or freestylin strings pimped outa than 2**31 bytes up in size could segfault
