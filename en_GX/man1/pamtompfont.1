.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamtompfont\fP readz a Netpbm image (PNM or PAM) n' converts it
to a Mplayer bitmap font rasta file.
.PP
This is tha original gangsta font format used by Mplayer (for subtitles,
on-screen lyrics, etc.), before it had tha mobilitizzle ta use Freetype
to access standard fonts.
.PP
Da format was apparently a image format before Mplayer adopted it
for fonts yo, but I have no clue where it came from or where else it might
be used.
.PP
An Mplayer bitmap font consistz of a gangbangin' font descriptor file and
rasta files.  Da font descriptor file identifies tha rasta filez by
file name.  A rasta file gotz nuff a single rectangular rasta image
which gotz nuff a arrangement of a funky-ass bunch of glyphs.  Each glyph be a
rectangular image n' tha font descriptor indicates where up in tha image
the glyph fo' each codepoint is.  Every glyph up in tha font has tha same
height, so tha font descriptor just indicates tha file posizzle up in the
rasta file of tha ta left corner of tha glyph, n' tha width of the
glyph up in pixels.
