.SH NAME
pwmake \- simple tool fo' generatin random relatively easily pronounceable
passwords
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpwmake\fR <entropy-bits>
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpwmake\fR be a simple configurable tool fo' generatin random n' relatively
easily pronounceable passwords. Da tool allows you ta specify tha number of
entropy bits dat is used ta generate tha password.

Da entropy is pulled from \fB/dev/urandom\fR.

Da minimum number of bits is \fB56\fR which is usable fo' passwordz on
systems/skillz where brute force attacks iz of straight-up limited rate of tries.
Da \fB64\fR bits should be adequate fo' applications where tha attacker
does not have direct access ta tha password hash file. For thangs where
the attacker might obtain tha direct access ta tha password hash or the
password is used as a encryption key \fB80\fR ta \fB128\fR bits should be
used dependin on yo' level of paranoia.

.PD
.SH OPTIONS
Da first n' only argument is tha number of bitz of entropy used ta generate
the password.

.SH FILES
\fB/etc/security/pwquality.conf\fR - Da configuration file fo' tha libpwquality
library.

.PD
.SH "RETURN CODES"
\fBpwmake\fR returns 0 on success, non zero on error.
