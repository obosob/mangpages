.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBppmtv\fP readz a PPM image as input n' dims every last muthafuckin other row of
image data down by tha specified dim factor. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  This factor may be in
the range of 0.0 (the alternate lines is straight-up black) ta 1.0
(original gangsta image).
.PP
This creates a effect similar ta what tha fuck I've once peeped up in tha vizzle
clip 'Yo ass could be mine' by Guns'n'Roses.  In tha scene I be rappin'
about you can peep Jizzy Connor on his crazy-ass motorbike, lookin up from the
wata trench (?)  da perved-out muthafucka standin in. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  While tha camera pulls back, the
image gets 'normal' by brightenin up tha alternate rowz of dat shit. I
thought dis would be a bangin-ass effect ta try up in MPEG. I did not
yet check dis out, however n' shit.  Try fo' yo ass.
