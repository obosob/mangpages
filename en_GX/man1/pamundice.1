two hyphens instead of one.  Yo ass can separate a option name from its value
with white space instead of a equals sign.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamundice\fP readz a funky-ass bunch of Netpbm images as input n' combines them
as a grid of tilez tha fuck into a single output image of tha same kind on Standard
Output.
.PP
Yo ass can optionally make tha pieces overlap.
.PP
See tha \fIinput_filename_pattern\fP argument fo' shiznit on
namin of tha input files.
.PP
Da input images must all have tha same format (PAM, PPM, etc.)
and maxval n' fo' PAM must have tha same depth n' tuple type.
All tha images up in a rank (horizontal row of tiles) must have the
same height.  All tha images up in a gangbangin' file (vertical column of tiles)
must have tha same width.  But it aint required dat every last muthafuckin rank
have tha same height or every last muthafuckin file have tha same width.
.PP
\fBpamdice\fP is tha inverse of \fBpamundice\fP.  Yo ass can use
\fBpamundice\fP ta reassemble a image sliced up by \fBpamdice\fP.
Yo ass can use \fBpamdice\fP ta recreate tha tilez of a image pimped
by \fBpamundice\fP yo, but ta do dis tha original gangsta ranks must all have
been tha same height except fo' tha bottom one n' tha original gangsta files
must all done been tha same width except tha right one.
.PP
One use fo' dis is ta make pieces dat take less computer
resources than tha whole image ta process.  For example, you might
have a image so big-ass dat a image editor can't read all dat shiznit into
memory or processes it straight-up slowly.  Yo ass can split it tha fuck into smaller
pieces wit \fBpamdice\fP, edit one at a time, n' then reassemble them
with \fBpamundice\fP.
.PP
An alternatizzle ta join images up in a single direction (i.e. a single
rank or a single file) is \fBpnmcat\fP.  \fBpnmcat\fP gives you more
flexibilitizzle than \fBpamundice\fP up in identifyin tha input images: you
can supply dem on Standard Input or as a list of arbitrarily named
files.
.PP
To join piecewise photographs, use \fBpnmstitch\fP instead of
\fBpamundice\fP, cuz it figures up where tha pieces overlap,
even if they don't overlap exactly vertically or horizontally.
.PP
To create a image of tha same tile repeated up in a grid, that's
\fBpnmtile\fP.
.PP
\fBpnmindex\fP do a similar thang ta \fBpamundice\fP: it
combines a funky-ass bunch of lil' small-ass images up in a grid tha fuck into a funky-ass big-ass one.  But its
purpose is ta produce a a index image of tha input images.  So it
leaves space between dem n' has labels fo' them, fo' example.

.UN arguments
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
There is one non-option argument, n' it is mandatory:
\fIinput_filename_pattern\fP.  This  drops some lyrics ta \fBpamundice\fP what tha fuck files
contain tha input tiles.
.PP
\fBpamundice\fP readz tha input images from filez which is named
with a pattern dat indicates they positions up in tha combined image.
For example, \fBtile_00_05.ppm\fP could be tha 6th tile over up in the
1st rank, while \fBtile_04_01\fP is tha 2nd tile over up in tha 5th rank.
.PP
Yo ass cannot supply any of tha data on Standard Input, n' tha files
must be tha kind dat \fBpamundice\fP can close n' reopen n' read
the same image a second time (e.g. a regular file is fine; a named
pipe is probably not).
.PP
\fIinput_filename_pattern\fP be a printf-style pattern, so check it before ya wreck it. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  (See the
standard C library \fBprintf\fP subroutine).  For tha example above,
it would be \fBtile_%2d_%2a.ppm\fP.  Da only possible conversion
specifiers are:



.TP
\fBd\fP
\&'down': Da rank (row) number, startin wit 0.

.TP
\fBa\fP
\&'across': Da file (column) number, startin wit 0.

.TP
\fB%\fP
Da per cent characta (%).


.PP
Da number between tha % n' tha conversion specifier is the
precision n' is required. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  It say how tha fuck nuff charactaz of tha file
name is busted lyrics bout by dat conversion. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Da rank or file number is
filled wit leadin zeroes as necessary.
.PP
So tha example \fBtile_%2d_%2a.ppm\fP means ta git tha name of
the file dat gotz nuff tha tile at Rank 0, File 5, you:



.IP \(bu
replace tha '%2d' wit tha rank number, as a 2 digit
decimal number: '00'

.IP \(bu
Replace tha '%2a' wit tha file number, as a 2 digit
decimal number: '05'

.PP
Note dat dis pattern raps bout file names dat \fBpamdice\fP
produces, except dat tha precision may be mo' or less.
(\fBpamdice\fP uses however nuff digits is required fo' tha highest
numbered image).


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-across=\fP\fIN\fP
This is tha number of tilez across up in tha grid, i.e. tha number of
tilez up in each rank, or tha number of files.
.sp
Default is 1.


.TP
\fB-down=\fP\fIN\fP
This is tha number of tilez up n' down up in tha grid, i.e. the
number of tilez up in each file, or tha number of ranks.
.sp
Default is 1.

.TP
\fB-hoverlap=\fP\fIpixels\fP
This is tha amount up in pixels ta overlap tha tilez horizontally.
\fBpamundice\fP clips dis much off tha right edge of every last muthafuckin tile
before joinin it ta tha adjacent image ta tha right.  Da tilez along
the right edge remain whole.
.sp
There must not be any input image narrower than all dis bullshit.
.sp
Note dat dis undoes tha effect of tha same \fB-hoverlap\fP
option of \fBpamdice\fP.
.sp
Default is zero -- no overlap.

.TP
\fB-voverlap=\fP\fIpixels\fP
This be analogous ta \fB-hoverlap\fP yo, but \fBpamundice\fP
clips tha bottom edge of each image before joinin it ta tha one below.

.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
Print shiznit bout tha processin ta Standard Error.



.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
\fBpamundice\fP was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.39 (June 2007).  Before that,
\fBpnmcat\fP is tha dopest substitute.
