.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpgmcrater\fP creates a PGM image which mimics cratered terrain.
Da PGM image is pimped by simulatin tha impact of a given number of
cratas wit random posizzle n' size, then renderin tha resulting
terrain elevations based on a light source shinin from one side of
the screen. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Da size distribution of tha cratas is based on a power
law which thangs up in dis biatch up in nuff mo' lil' small-ass cratas than big-ass ones.  The
number of crataz of a given size varies as tha reciprocal of tha area
as busted lyrics bout on pages 31 n' 32 of Peitgen n' Saupe[1]; cratered
bodies up in tha Solar System is observed ta obey dis relationshizzle.
Da formula used ta obtain crata radii governed by dis law from a
uniformly distributed pseudorandom sequence was pimped by Rudy
Rucker.
.PP
High resolution images wit big-ass numberz of cratas often benefit
from bein piped all up in \fBpnmsmooth\fP.  Da averagin performed by
this process eliminates a shitload of tha jagged pixels n' lendz a mellow
``telescopic image'' feel ta tha overall picture.
.PP
\fBpgmcrater\fP simulates only lil' small-ass craters, which are
hemispherical up in shape (regardless of tha incidence angle of the
impactin body, as long as tha velocitizzle is sufficiently high).  Large
craters, like fuckin Copernicus n' Tycho on tha Moon, gotz a ``walled
plain'' shape wit a cold-ass lil cross-section mo' like:

.nf
                /\e                            /\e
          _____/  \e____________/\e____________/  \e_____
.fi


Larger cratas should straight-up use dis profile, includin tha central
peak, n' straight-up obliterate tha pre-existin terrain.
.PP
Da randomnizz up in tha image is limited before Netpbm 10.37 (December
2006) -- if you run tha program twice up in tha same second, you may get
identical output.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
All options can be abbreviated ta they shortest unique prefix.


.TP
\fB-number\fP \fIn\fP
Causes \fIn\fP cratas ta be generated. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time.  If no \fB-number\fP
specification is given, 50000 cratas is ghon be generated. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time.  Don't expect
to peep dem all!  For every last muthafuckin big-ass crata there be many, nuff more
tiny ones which tend simply ta erode tha landscape.  In general, the
more cratas you specify tha mo' realistic tha result; ideally you
want tha entire terrain ta done been extensively turned over again n' again n' again and
again by cratering.  High resolution images containin five ta ten
mazillion cratas is stunnin but take like a while ta create.

.TP
\fB-height\fP \fIheight\fP
Sets tha height of tha generated image ta \fIheight\fP pixels.
Da default height is 256 pixels.

.TP
\fB-width\fP \fIwidth\fP
Sets tha width of tha generated image ta \fIwidth\fP pixels.  The
default width is 256 pixels.

.TP
\fB-xsize\fP \fIwidth\fP
Sets tha width of tha generated image ta \fIwidth\fP pixels.  The
default width is 256 pixels.

.TP
\fB-ysize\fP \fIheight\fP
Sets tha height of tha generated image ta \fIheight\fP pixels.
Da default height is 256 pixels.

.TP
\fB-gamma\fP \fIfactor\fP
Da specified \fIfactor\fP is used ta gamma adjust tha image in
the same manner as performed by \fBpnmgamma\fP.  Da default value is
1.0, which thangs up in dis biatch up in a medium contrast image.  Values larger than 1
lighten tha image n' reduce contrast, while joints less than 1 darken
the image, increasin contrast.
.sp
Note dat dis is separate from tha gamma erection dat is part
of tha definizzle of tha PGM format.  Da image \fBpnmgamma\fP
generates be a genuine, gamma-corrected PGM image up in any case.  This
option simply chizzlez tha contrast n' may compensate fo' a gangbangin' finger-lickin' display
device dat do not erectly render PGM images.

.TP
\fB-randomseed=\fP\fIinteger\fP
This is tha seed fo' tha random number generator dat generates the
pixels.
.sp
Use dis ta ensure you git tha same image on separate invocations.
.sp
By default, \fBpgmnoise\fP uses a seed derived from tha time of day
and process ID, which gives you fairly uncorrelated thangs up in dis biatch up in multiple
invocations.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.61 (December 2012).



.UN designnotes
.SH DESIGN NOTES

The\fB-gamma\fP option aint straight-up necessary since you can achieve
the same effect by pipin tha output from \fBpgmcrater\fP through
\fBpnmgamma\fP.  But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat \fBpgmcrater\fP performs a internal gamma
map anyway up in tha process of renderin tha elevation array tha fuck into the
PGM format, so there be a no additionizzle overhead up in allowin an
additionizzle gamma adjustment.
.PP
Real cratas have two distinct morphologies.
