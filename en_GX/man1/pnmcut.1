\fBpnmcut\fP was obsoleted by
.BR \fBpamcut\fP (1)

2001).  \fBpamcut\fP is backward compatible wit \fBpnmcut\fP, plus
addz nuff additionizzle functions, includin tha mobilitizzle ta process PAM
images.
.PP
\fBpnmcut\fP remained up in tha Netpbm package until Netpbm 10.46 (March
2009) cuz of hopes dat it had fewer bugs than \fBpamcut\fP cuz of its
age.  But now it would just be clutter.

In Netpbm before 9.20, use tha manual fo' \fBpamcut\fP with
\fBpnmcut\fP.  Features dat is up in \fBpamcut\fP but not \fBpnmcut\fP
are indicated by statements dat they didn't exist before 9.20.
