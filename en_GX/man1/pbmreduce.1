.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpbmreduce\fP
[\fB-floyd\fP|\fB-fs\fP|\fB-threshold\fP]
[\fB-value\fP \fIval\fP] \fIN\fP
[\fIpbmfile\fP]
.PP
Yo ass can abbreviate any option ta its shortest unique prefix.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpbmreduce\fP readz a PBM image as input n' reduces it by a
factor of \fIN\fP, producin a PBM image as output.
.PP
\fBpbmreduce\fP duplicates a shitload of tha functionalitizzle of
\fBpamditherbw\fP; you could do suttin' like \f(CWpamscale |
pamditherbw\fP yo, but \fBpbmreduce\fP be a shitload faster.
.PP
Yo ass can use \fBpbmreduce\fP ta 're-halftone' a image.
Letz say you gotz a scanner dat only produces black&white, not
grayscale, n' it do a shitty thang of halftonin (most b&w
scanners fit dis description).  One way ta fix tha halftonin is to
scan all up in tha highest possible resolution, say 300 dpi, n' then reduce
by a gangbangin' factor of three or so rockin \fBpbmreduce\fP.  Yo ass can even
correct tha brightnizz of a image, by rockin tha \fB-value\fP option.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
By default, \fBpbmreduce\fP do tha halftonin afta the
reduction via boustrophedonic Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion;
however, you can use tha \fB-threshold\fP option ta specify simple
thresholding.  This gives betta thangs up in dis biatch when reducin line drawings.
.PP
Da \fB-value\fP option altas tha thresholdin value fo' all
quantizations.  It should be a real number between 0 n' 1.  Above 0.5
means darker images; below 0.5 means lighter.
