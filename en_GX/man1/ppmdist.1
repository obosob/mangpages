.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBppmdist\fP

[\fB-intensity\fP|\fB-frequency\fP]

[\fIppmfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBppmdist\fP readz a PPM image as input n' performs a simplistic
grayscale assignment intended fo' use wit grayscale or bitmap
printers.
.PP
Often conversion from ppm ta pgm will yield a image wit contrast
too low fo' phat printa output.  Da program maximizes contrast
between tha gray levels output.
.PP
A ppm input of n flavas is read, n' a pgm of n gray levels is
written. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Da gray levels take on tha joints 0..n-1, while maxval
takes on n-1.
.PP
Da mappin from color ta stepped grayscale can be performed in
order of input pixel intensity, or input pixel frequency (number of
repetitions).
.PP
This program is helpful only fo' images wit a straight-up lil' small-ass number of
colors.


.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-frequency\fP
Sort input flavas by tha number of times a cold-ass lil color appears up in the
input, before mappin ta evenly distributed graylevelz of output.

.TP
\fB-intensity\fP
Sort input flavas by they grayscale intensity, before mappin to
evenly distributed graylevelz of output.  This is tha default.
