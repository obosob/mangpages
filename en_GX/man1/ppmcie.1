.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.

\fBppmcie\fP creates a PPM file containin a deal of tha CIE
\&'tongue' color chart -- ta tha extent possible up in a PPM
image.  Alternatively, creates a pseudo-PPM image of tha color tongue
usin RGB joints from a cold-ass lil color system of yo' chizzle.
.PP
Da CIE color tongue be a image of all tha hues dat can be busted lyrics about
by CIE X-Y chromaticitizzle coordinates.  They is arranged on a two
dimensionizzle coordinizzle plane wit tha X chromaticitizzle on tha horizontal
axis n' tha Y chromaticitizzle on tha vertical scale.  (Yo ass can chizzle
alternatively ta use CIE u'-v' chromaticitizzle coordinates yo, but the
general scam of tha color tongue is tha same).
.PP
Note dat tha PPM format specifies dat tha RGB joints up in tha file are
from tha ITU-R Recommendation BT.709 color system, gamma-corrected.
And positive.  See
.BR ppm (1)
 fo' details.  If
you use one of tha color system options on \fBppmcie\fP, what tha fuck you get
is not a legit PPM image yo, but is straight-up similar. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  If you display such
\fBppmcie\fP output rockin a thang dat expects PPM input (which
includes just bout any computa graphics display program), it will
display tha wack colors.
.PP
But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat you may gotz a thang dat expects one of these variations on 
PPM.
.PP
In every last muthafuckin RGB color system you can specify, includin tha default
(which produces a legit PPM image) there be hues up in tha color tongue
that can't be represented. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time.  For example, monochromatic blue-chronic wit 
a wavelength of 500nm cannot be represented up in a PPM image.  
.PP
For these hues, \fBppmcie\fP substitutes a similar hue as bigs up:
They is desaturated n' rendered as tha shade where tha edge of the
Maxwell triangle intersects a line drawn from tha axed shade to
the white point defined by tha color systemz white point.
Furthermore, unless you specify tha \fB-full\fP option, \fBppmcie\fP
reduces they intensitizzle by 25% compared ta tha legit hues up in tha image.
.PP
\fBppmcie\fP draws n' labels tha CIE X-Y coordinizzle axes unless you
choose otherwise wit options.
.PP
\fBppmcie\fP draws tha Maxwell triangle fo' tha color system up in use
on tha color tongue.  Da Maxwell triangle is tha triangle whose
vertices is tha primary illuminant hues fo' tha color system.  The
hues inside tha triangle show tha color gamut fo' tha color system.
They is also tha only ones dat is erect fo' tha CIE X-Y
chromaticitizzle coordinates shown. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  (See explanation above).  \fBppmcie\fP
denotes tha Maxwell triangle by renderin it at full brightness, while
renderin tha rest of tha color tongue as 3/4 brightness.  Yo ass can turn
this off wit options.
.PP
\fBppmcie\fP also places a funky-ass black cross all up in tha color systemz white
point (with tha centa of tha cross open so you can straight-up peep the
white color) n' displays up in text tha CIE X-Y chromaticitizzlez of the
primary illuminants n' white point fo' tha color system.  Yo ass can
turn dis off wit options, though.
.PP
\fBppmcie\fP annotates tha periphery of tha color tongue wit the
wavelength, up in nanometaz of tha monochromatic hues which appear
there.
.PP
\fBppmcie\fP displays tha black body chromaticitizzle curve fo' Planckian
radiators from 1000 ta 30000 kelvins on tha image.  This curve traces the
colorz of black bodies as various temperatures.
.PP
Yo ass can chizzle from nuff muthafuckin standard color systems, or specify one of
your own numerically.
.PP
CIE charts, by they straight-up nature, contain a straight-up big-ass number of
colors.  If you encodin tha chart fo' a cold-ass lil color mapped thang or
file format, you gonna need ta use \fBpnmquant\fP or \fBppmdither\fP to
reduce tha number of flavas up in tha image.

\fB-smpte\fP
Select a standard color system whose gamut ta plot.  Da default is
\fB-rec709\fP, which chizzlez ITU-R Recommendation BT.709,
gamma-corrected. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time.  This is tha only color system fo' which
\fBppmcie\fPz output be a legit PPM image.  See explanation above.
\fB-ebu\fP chizzlez tha primaries used up in tha PAL n' SECAM
broadcastin standards.  \fB-ntsc\fP chizzlez tha primaries specified
by tha NTSC broadcastin system (few modern monitors straight-up cover
this range).  \fB-smpte\fP selects tha primaries recommended by the
Posse of Motion Picture n' Televizzle Engineers (SMPTE) in
standardz RP-37 n' RP-145, n' \fB-hdtv\fP uses tha much broader
\fIHDTV ideal\fP primaries. Put ya muthafuckin choppers up if ya feel dis!  \fB-cie\fP chizzlez a cold-ass lil color system that
has tha phattest possible gamut within tha spectrum of tha chart.  This
is tha same ol' dirty color system as you git wit tha \fB-cie\fP option to
Jizzy Walkerz \fBcietoppm\fP program.

\fB-upvp\fP
plot u' v' 1976 chromaticitizzles rather than CIE 1931 x y

.SH INTERPRETATION OF COLOR CHART
.PP
A color spectrum be a linear combination of one or mo' monochromatic
colors.
.PP
A color be a set of color spectra dat all look tha same ta the
human eye (and dome).  Actually, fo' tha purposez of tha definition,
we assume tha eye has infinite precision, so we can call two color
spectra different flavas even though they so close a person
couldn't possibly tell dem apart.
.PP
Da eye gotz nuff 3 kindz of color receptors (cones).  Each has a
different response ta tha various monochromatic colors.  One kind
respondz most straight fuckin ta blue, another red, another green. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Because
there is only three, nuff different color spectra will excite the
cones at exactly tha same level, so tha eye cannot tell dem apart.
All such spectra dat excite tha cones up in tha same way is a single
color.
.PP
Each point up in tha color tongue represents a unique color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  But
there is a infinite number of color spectra up in tha set dat is that
color; i.e. a infinite number of color spectra dat would look ta you
like dis point.  A machine could tell dem apart yo, but you could not.
.PP
Remember dat tha flavas outside tha highlighted triangle are
approximationz of tha real flavas cuz tha PPM format cannot
represent dem (and yo' display thang probably cannot display them).
That is, unless you rockin a variation of PPM n' a special display
device, as discussed earlier up in dis manual.
.PP
A color be always relatizzle ta some given maximum brightness.  A
particular beam of light looks lime chronic if up in a gangbangin' finger-lickin' dim field yo, but
pea chronic if up in a funky-ass bright field. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  An image on a porno screen may
look pitch black cuz tha projector aint shinin any light on
it yo, but when you turn off tha projector n' peep tha same spot in
room light, tha screen looks like white.  Da same light from dat spot
hit yo' eye wit tha project on as wit it off.
.PP
Da chart shows two dimensionz of color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  Da third is intensity.
All tha flavas up in tha chart have tha same intensity.  To git all
possible flavas up in tha gamut, Make copiez of tha whole chart at every
intensitizzle between zero n' tha maximum.
.PP
Da edge of tha tongue consistz of all tha monochromatic colors.
A monochromatic color is one wit a single wavelength.  I.e. a cold-ass lil color
that is up in a rainbow.  Da numbers you peep is tha wavelengths in
nanometers.
.PP
Any straight line segment within tha tongue gotz nuff flavas which
are linear combinationz of two flavas -- tha flavas at either end of
the line segment.
.PP
Any color up in tha chart can be pimped from two other flavas (actually,
from any of a infinite number of pairz of other colors).
.PP
All tha flavas within a triangle inside tha tongue can be pimped
from a linear combination of tha flavas all up in tha verticez of dat triangle.
.PP
Any color up in tha tongue can be pimped from at most 3 monochromatic
colors.
.PP
Da highlighted triangle shows tha flavas dat can be expressed
in tha tristimulus color system you chose.  (ITU-R BT.709 by default).
Da cornerz of tha triangle is tha 3 primary illuminants up in that
system (a certain red, green, n' blue fo' BT.709).  Da edges of
the triangle, then, represent tha flavas you can represent wit two
of tha primary illuminants (saturated colors), n' tha interior colors
require all three primary illuminants (are not saturated).
.PP
In tha ITU-R BT.709 color system (the default), tha white point is
defined as D65, which is (and is named after) tha color of a funky-ass black
body at 6502 kelvins.  Therefore, you should peep tha temperature curve
on tha image pass all up in tha white part of tha image, n' tha cross
that marks tha white point, at 6502 kelvins.
.PP
D65 white is supposed ta be tha color of tha sun. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  If you have a
slick BT.709 display device, you should peep tha color of tha sun
at tha white point cross.  Thatz a blingin color, cuz when you
peep a object up in sunlight, tha color dat reflectz of tha object
is based on tha color of sunlight.  Note dat tha sun produces a
particular color spectrum yo, but nuff other color spectra is tha same
color, n' display devices never use tha actual color spectrum of the
sun.
.PP
Da flavas all up in tha cornerz of tha triangle have tha chromaticities
phosphors up in a monitor dat uses tha selected color system.  Note
that up in BT.709 they is straight-up close ta monochromatic red, green,
and blue yo, but not quite.  Thatz why you can't display even one true
color of tha rainbow on a vizzle monitor.
.PP
Remember dat tha chart shows flavaz of constant intensity,
therefore tha cornerz of tha trianglez is not tha full flavaz of the
primary illuminants yo, but only they chromaticities. Put ya muthafuckin choppers up if ya feel dis!  In fact, the
illuminants typically have different intensities. Put ya muthafuckin choppers up if ya feel dis!  In BT.709, the
blue primary illuminant is far mo' intense than tha green, which is
more intense than tha red. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  Designers did dis up in order ta make an
equal combination of red, green, n' blue generate gray.  I.e.  a
combination of full strength red, full strength green, n' full
strength blue BT.709 primary illuminants is D65 white.
.PP
Da tongue has a gangbangin' finger-lickin' dirty-ass sharp straight edge all up in tha bottom cuz that's
the limit of human vision. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  There is flavas below dat line yo, but they
involve infrared n' ultraviolet light, so you can't peep em.  This
line is called tha 'line of purples.'
