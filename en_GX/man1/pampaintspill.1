.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpampaintspill\fP produces a smooth color gradient from all of the
non-background-colored pixels up in a input image, effectively <q>spilling
paint</q> onto tha background. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  \fBpampaintspill\fP is similar to
\fBpamgradient\fP but differs up in tha followin characteristics:


.IP \(bu
\fBpampaintspill\fP accepts any number of paint
      sources (non-background-colored pixels), which can lie anywhere
      on tha canvas.  \fBpamgradient\fP accepts exactly
      four paint sources, one up in each corner of tha image.

.IP \(bu
\fBpampaintspill\fP requires a input image while
      \fBpamgradient\fP generates a freshly smoked up image from
      scratch.

.IP \(bu
\fBpampaintspill\fP can produce tileable output and
      can control how tha fuck tightly tha gradient flavas bind ta they source
      pixels.

.PP
Results is generally dopest when tha input image gotz nuff just a gangbangin' few, crisp
spotz of color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke. Use yo' drawin programz pencil tool &mdash; as opposed ta a
paintbrush or airbrush tool &mdash; wit a lil' small-ass nib.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB--bgcolor\fP=\fIcolor\fP
  
Explicitly specify tha background color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke. \fIcolor\fP can be
      specified rockin any of tha formats accepted by tha 
.UR libppm.html#colorname
\f(CWppm_parsecolor()\fP library       routine
.UE
\& like fuckin \f(CWred\fP or \f(CW#ff0000\fP.  If
      \fB--bgcolor\fP aint specified, \fBpampaintspill\fP make an
      constipated guess bout tha background color based on tha flavas up in the
      imagez corners.

.TP
\fB--wrap\fP
  
Allow gradients ta wrap round image borders. That is, colors
      dat spill off tha right side of tha image reappear on tha left side of
      tha image n' likewise fo' left/right, top/bottom, and
      bottom/top. \fB--wrap\fP make images tileable, which is sick for
      producin desktop backgrounds.

.TP
\fB--all\fP
  
Recolor all pixels, not just background pixels. Normally,
      non-background-colored pixels up in tha input image step tha fuck up unmodified in
      tha output image. With \fB--all\fP, \fIall\fP pixels is colored
      based on they distizzle from all of tha (other) non-background-colored
      pixels.

.TP
\fB--downsample\fP=\fInumber\fP
  
Ignore all but \fInumber\fP non-background-colored pixels.
      When a big-ass number of pixels up in tha input image differ up in color from
      tha background, \fBpampaintspill\fP runs straight-up slowly. The
      \fB--downsample\fP option randomly selects a given number of colored
      pixels ta use as paint sources fo' tha gradients n' ignores tha rest,
      thereby tradin off image qualitizzle fo' speed of execution.

.TP
\fB--power\fP=\fInumber\fP
  
Control how tha fuck color intensitizzle chizzlez as a gangbangin' function of the
      distizzle from a paint source. Da default value fo' \fInumber\fP is
      -2.0, which means dat intensitizzle drops (because of tha minus sign) with
      tha square (because of tha 2.0) of tha distizzle from each paint
      source. -2.0 generally works well up in practice yo, but other joints can be
      specified fo' various special effects, n' you can put dat on yo' toast. With straight-up lil' small-ass numberz of paint
      sources, -1.0 may produce subtla gradients yo, but these git muddier as
      tha number of paint sources increases. Positizzle numbers (e.g., 1.0 and
      2.0) make tha paint sources stand up in tha output image by pushin the
      gradients away from em.
