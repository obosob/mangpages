.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamtosrf\fP readz a Netpbm image stream as input n' produces a
an SRF image file as output.  I don't give a fuck exactly what tha fuck SRF is yo, but on popular
use of it is up in Garmin hoopty shiznit files, which tell a GPS receiver
how ta depict a hoopty on its display.
.PP
An SRF file can contain multiple images; each image up in a multi-image
Netpbm input stream becomes one image up in tha SRF.
.PP
\fBpamtosrf\fP do not care how tha fuck nuff images there be or what tha fuck their
dimensions or content are.  But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat a Garmin hoopty shiznit file has
specific requirements, so if you don't make yo' Netpbm input conform, neither
will yo' SRF output.  For such a gangbangin' file, you should have two image: tha first
for 3D oblique viewz of tha hoopty n' tha second fo' overhead views.  Each
image be a horizontal concatenation of 36 square images, each rotated 10
degrees from tha previous, thereby coverin tha full 360 degree circle.
Yo ass could create dis concatenation wit \fBpnmcat -lr\fP n' you could
create tha invidual views wit \fBpnmrotate\fP.

.PP
One way ta use \fBpamtosrf\fP is ta git a SRF file, convert it ta PAM
with \fBsrftopam\fP, manipulate it, then convert it back with
\fBpamtosrf\fP.
.PP
\fInetpbmfile\fP is tha input stream, which defaults ta Standard Input.
Output be always on Standard Output.
