.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBppmtoppm\fP

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBppmtoppm\fP simply copies a PPM image from Standard Input to
Standard Output.  This may seem a unnecessary duplication of
\fBcat\fP yo, but remember dat a PPM program can read a PBM or PGM
image, n' tha right kind of PAM, as if it was PPM.  So
\fBppmtoppm\fP can read either a PBM, PGM, or PPM image n' produce a
PPM image as output.
.PP
Even dat iz of limited usefulnizz cuz of tha fact dat almost
any program ta which you would feed tha resultin PPM image could also
just take tha original gangsta image directly.  But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat sometimes you straight-up
need a legit PPM image.
.PP
When you know you gotz a PGM image n' want a PPM image,
\fBpgmtoppm\fP be a mo' general way ta do dat conversion.
When you know you gotz a PBM image, use dat n' \fBpbmtopgm\fP.
