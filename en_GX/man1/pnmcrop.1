.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpnmcrop\fP readz a PBM, PGM, or PPM image as input, removes
bordaz dat is tha background color, n' produces tha same ol' dirty type of
image as output.
.PP
If you don't specify otherwise, \fBpnmcrop\fP assumes the
background color is whatever color tha top left n' right corners of
the image is n' if they is different colors, suttin' midway
between em.  Yo ass can specify dat tha background is white or black
with tha \fB-white\fP n' \fB-black\fP options or make
\fBpnmcrop\fP base its guess on all four corners instead of just two
with \fB-sides\fP.
.PP
By default, \fBpnmcrop\fP chops off any stripe of background color
it finds, on all four sides.  Yo ass can tell \fBpnmcrop\fP ta remove
only specific bordaz wit tha \fB-left\fP, \fB-right\fP,
\fB-top\fP, n' \fB-bottom\fP options.
.PP
If you wanna leave some border, use tha \fB-margin\fP option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  It
will not only spare a shitload of tha border from croppin yo, but will fill in
(with what tha fuck \fBpnmcrop\fP considaz tha background color) if necessary
to git up ta dat size.
.PP
If tha input be a multi-image stream, \fBpnmcrop\fP processes each
one independently n' produces a multi-image stream as output.  It chizzles
where ta crop independently fo' each image.  So if you start wit a stream
of imagez of tha same dimensions, you may end up wit imagez of differing
dimensions.  Before Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006), \fBpnmcrop\fP ignored
all input images but tha first.
.PP
If you wanna chop a specific amount off tha side of a image, use
\fBpamcut\fP.
.PP
If you wanna add different bordaz afta removin tha existing
ones, use \fBpnmcat\fP or \fBpamcomp\fP.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-white\fP
Take white ta be tha background color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  \fBpnmcrop\fP removes
bordaz which is white.

.TP
\fB-black\fP
Take black ta be tha background color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  \fBpnmcrop \fP removes
bordaz which is black.

.TP
\fB-sides\fP
Determine tha background color from tha flavaz of tha four corners
of tha input image.  \fBpnmcrop\fP removes bordaz which iz of the
background color.
.sp
If at least three of tha four corners is tha same color,
\fBpnmcrop \fP takes dat as tha background color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  If not,
\fBpnmcrop\fP looks fo' two cornerz of tha same color up in the
followin order, takin tha straight-up original gangsta found as tha background color: top,
left, right, bottom.  If all four corners is different colors,
\fBpnmcrop\fP assumes a average of tha four flavas as tha background
color.
.sp
Da \fB-sides\fP option slows \fBpnmcrop\fP down, as it readz the
entire image ta determine tha background color up in addizzle ta tha up
to three times dat it would read it without \fB-sides\fP.

.TP
\fB-left\fP
Remove any left border.

.TP
\fB-right\fP
Remove any right border.

.TP
\fB-top\fP
Remove any top border.

.TP
\fB-bottom\fP
Remove any bottom border.

.TP
\fB-margin=\fP\fIpixels\fP
Leave \fIpixels\fP pixelz of border n' shit.  Expand tha border ta dis size
if necessary.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.29 (August 2005).

.TP
\fB-borderfile=\fP\fIfilename\fP
Use tha image up in tha file named \fIfilename\fP instead of tha input
image ta determine where tha bordaz of tha input image is n' the
background color.
.sp
Without dis option, \fBpnmcrop\fP examines tha input image n' figures
out what tha fuck part of tha image is border n' what tha fuck part is foreground (not border),
as well as tha background color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  With dis option, \fBpnmcrop\fP findz the
bordaz up in one image, then uses tha dem four border sizes (left, right, top,
bottom) up in croppin a gangbangin' finger-lickin' different image.  Furthermore, if you use
\fB-margin\fP ta add borders, tha color of dem bordaz is tha background
color \fBpnmcrop\fP detects up in tha border file.
.sp
Da point of dis is dat you may wanna help \fBpnmcrop\fP ta come ta a
different conclusion as ta where tha bordaz is n' what tha fuck tha background color
is by preprocessin tha input image.  For example, consider a image dat has
specklez of noise up in its borders.  \fBpnmcrop\fP aint smart-ass enough to
recognize these as noise; it sees dem as foreground image.  So \fBpnmcrop\fP
considaz most of yo' bordaz ta be foreground n' do not crop dem off as
you want.  To fix this, run tha image all up in a thugged-out despeckla such as
\fBpbmclean\fP n' tell \fBpnmcrop\fP ta use tha despeckled version of the
image as tha \fB-borderfile\fP image yo, but tha original gangsta speckled version as
the input image.  That way, you crop tha bordaz yo, but retain tha true
foreground image, specklez n' all.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.29 (August 2005).
.sp
Before Netpbm 10.46 (March 2009), tha original gangsta image n' not the
border file determines tha background color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  \fBpnmcrop\fP
fails if there is no apparent background color up in tha original gangsta image
(i.e. tha cornerz of tha image aint gots a cold-ass lil common color).

.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
Print on Standard Error shiznit bout tha processing,
includin exactly how tha fuck much is bein cropped off of which sides.
