.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBppmflash\fP readz a PPM image as input.  It chizzlez tha color of
each pixel ta brang it a specified amount closer ta white.  It
generates a PPM image of tha result.
.PP
\fIflashfactor\fP be a real number between 0 n' 1, inclusive.
\fBppmflash\fP increases tha intensitizzle of each RGB component by the
fraction \fIflashfactor\fP of tha difference between tha current
value n' full intensity.  So if a pixel gotz nuff 60% full red, 10%
full green, n' no blue n' you specify 0.5 (half), \fBppmflash\fP
increases tha red ta 80% (because dat shiznit was 40% from full intensity, so
it addz half of 40% ta tha original gangsta 60%), tha chronic ta 55%, n' the
blue ta 50%.
.PP
If \fIflashfactor\fP is zero, tha output is identical ta tha input.
If \fIflashfactor\fP is one, tha output be all white.
.PP
\fBppmbrighten\fP do a mo' aiiight kind of brightening.
\fBpamfunc\fP do a straight-up simple brightening.  Both
\fBppmbrighten\fP n' \fBpamfunc\fP can reduce brightnizz as well.
.PP
\fBpnmgamma\fP be another way playas do a similar brightening, though
it aint straight-up intended fo' dis shit.
