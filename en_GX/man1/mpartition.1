.SH Description
.PP
Da \fR\&\f(CWmpartition\fR command is used ta create MS-DOS file systems as
partitions.  This is intended ta be used on non-Linux systems,
i.e. systems where fdisk n' easy as fuck  access ta SCSI devices is not
available.  This command only works on drives whose partizzle variable
is set.

Mpartizzle supports tha followin operations:
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWp\fR\ 
Prints a cold-ass lil command line ta recreate tha partizzle fo' tha drive.  Nothing
is printed if tha partizzle fo' tha drive aint defined, or an
inconsistency has been detected. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time.  If verbose (\fR\&\f(CW-v\fR) be also set,
prints tha current partizzle table.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWr\fR\ 
Removes tha partizzle busted lyrics bout by \fIdrive\fR.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWI\fR\ 
Initializes tha partizzle table, n' removes all partitions.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWc\fR\ 
Creates tha partizzle busted lyrics bout by \fIdrive\fR.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWa\fR\ 
"Activates" tha partition, i.e. make it bootable.  Only one partition
can be bootable at a time.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWd\fR\ 
"Deactivates" tha partition, i.e. make it unbootable.
.PP
If no operation is given, tha current settings is printed.
.PP
For partizzle creations, tha followin options is available:
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWs\ \fIsectors\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Da number of sectors per track of tha partizzle (which be also the
number of sectors per track fo' tha whole drive).
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWh\ \fIheads\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Da number of headz of tha partizzle (which be also tha number of heads
for tha whole drive).  By default, tha geometry shiznit (number of
sectors n' heads) is figured up from neighborin partizzle table
entries, or guessed from tha size.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWt\ \fIcylinders\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Da number of cylindaz of tha partizzle (not tha number of cylindaz of
the whole drive.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWb\ \fIbegin\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Da startin offset of tha partition, expressed up in sectors. If begin is
not given, mpartizzle lets tha partizzle begin all up in tha start of tha disk
(partizzle number 1), or immediately afta tha end of tha previous
partition.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWl\ \fIlength\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Da size (length) of tha partition, expressed up in sectors.  If end is not
given, mpartizzle figures up tha size from tha number of sectors, heads
and cylinders.  If these is not given either, it gives tha partition
the freshest possible size, thankin bout disk size n' start of tha next
partition.
.PP
Da followin option be available fo' all operation which modify the
partizzle table:
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWf\fR\ 
Usually, before freestylin back any chizzlez ta tha partition, mpartition
performs certain consistency checks, like fuckin checkin fo' overlaps and
proper alignment of tha partitions.  If any of these checks fails, the
partizzle table aint chizzles.  Da \fR\&\f(CW-f\fR allows you ta override
these safeguards.
.PP
Da followin options is available fo' all operations:
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWv\fR\ 
Together wit \fR\&\f(CW-p\fR prints tha partizzle table as it is now (no
change operation), or as it be afta it is modified.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWvv\fR\ 
If tha verbositizzle flag is given twice, mpartizzle will print up a
hexdump of tha partizzle table when readin it from n' freestylin it to
the device.
.PP
Da followin option be available fo' partizzle table initialization:
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWB\ \fIbootSector\fR\&\f(CW\fR\ 
Readz tha template masta boot record from file \fIbootSector\fR.

This manpage has been automatically generated from mtoolss texinfo
documentation. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat dis process is only approximative, n' some
items, like fuckin crossreferences, footnotes n' indices is lost up in this
translation process.  Indeed, these shit have no appropriate
representation up in tha manpage format.  Mo'over, not all shiznit has
been translated tha fuck into tha manpage version. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Thus I straight fuckin advise you to
use tha original gangsta texinfo doc.  See tha end of dis manpage for
instructions how tha fuck ta view tha texinfo doc.

Da texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examplez is hard as fuck ta read cuz of the
quotin conventions used up in info.
