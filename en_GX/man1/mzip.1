.SH Description
.PP
Da \fR\&\f(CWmzip\fR command is used ta issue ZIP disk specific commandz on
Linux, Solaris or HP-UX. Its syntax is:
.PP
.ft I
.nf
\&\fR\&\f(CWmzip\fR [\fR\&\f(CW-epqrwx\fR]
.fi
.ft R
 
.PP
\&\fR\&\f(CWMzip\fR allows tha following
command line options:
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWe\fR\ 
Ejects tha disk.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWf\fR\ 
Force eject even if tha disk is mounted (must be given up in addizzle to
\&\fR\&\f(CW-e\fR).
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWr\fR\ 
Write protect tha disk.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWw\fR\ 
Remove write protection.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWp\fR\ 
Password write protect.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWx\fR\ 
Password protect
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWu\fR\ 
Temporarily unprotect tha disk until it is ejected. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time.  Da disk becomes
writable, n' reverts back ta its oldschool state when ejected.
.TP
\&\fR\&\f(CWq\fR\ 
Queries tha status
.PP
To remove tha password, set it ta one of tha password-less modes
\&\fR\&\f(CW-r\fR or \fR\&\f(CW-w\fR: mzip will then ask you fo' tha password, and
unlock tha disk.  If you have forgotten tha password, you can git rid of
it by low-level formattin tha disk (usin yo' SCSI adapterz BIOS
setup).
.PP
Da ZipTools disk shipped wit tha drive be also password protected. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time.  On
MS-DOS or on a Mac, dis password be automatically removed once the
ZipTools done been installed. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  From various articlez posted ta Usenet, I
learned dat tha password fo' tha tools disk is
\&\fR\&\f(CWAPlaceForYourStuff\fR\fR.  Mzip knows bout this
password, n' tries it first, before promptin you fo' a password. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  Thus
\&\fR\&\f(CWmzip -w z:\fR unlocks tha tools disk.  Da tools disk is
formatted up in a special way so as ta be usable both up in a PC n' up in a Mac.
On a PC, tha Mac file system appears as a hidden file named
\&\fR\&\f(CW\(ifpartishn.mac\(is\fR.  Yo ass may erase it ta reclaim tha 50 Megz of space
taken up by tha Mac file system.
.PP
.SH Bugs
.PP
This command be a funky-ass big-ass kludge.  A proper implementation would take a
rework of dope partz of mtools yo, but unfortunately I don't have
the time fo' dis n' aint a thugged-out damn thang dat yo' ass can do. Da main downside of dis implementation is
that it is inefficient on some architectures (several successive calls
to mtools, which defeats mtools' caching).

.SH Viewing\ the\ texi\ doc
This manpage has been automatically generated from mtoolss texinfo
documentation. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat dis process is only approximative, n' some
items, like fuckin crossreferences, footnotes n' indices is lost up in this
translation process.  Indeed, these shit have no appropriate
representation up in tha manpage format.  Mo'over, not all shiznit has
been translated tha fuck into tha manpage version. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Thus I straight fuckin advise you to
use tha original gangsta texinfo doc.  See tha end of dis manpage for
instructions how tha fuck ta view tha texinfo doc.

Da texinfo doc looks most pretty when printed or as html.  Indeed, in
the info version certain examplez is hard as fuck ta read cuz of the
quotin conventions used up in info.
