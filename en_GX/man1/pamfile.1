.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamfile\fP readz one or mo' Netpbm filez as input n' writes
out short descriptionz of tha image type, size, etc.  This is kinda
for use up in shell scripts, so tha format aint particularly pretty.
.PP
By default, \fBpamfile\fP readz only tha header of tha input file.
If dat file be a pipe, dat might cause problems fo' tha process dat is
feedin tha pipe.  In dat case, peep tha \fB-allimages\fP option.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-allimages\fP
This option causes \fBpamfile\fP ta describe every last muthafuckin image up in each
input file.  Without dis option, \fBpamfile\fP raps bout only the
first image up in each input file.
.sp
This option also causes \fBpamfile\fP ta read all tha images from 
the input stream, whereas without it, \fBpamfile\fP readz only tha header
of tha straight-up original gangsta one.  If tha input stream is from a pipe, tha process dat is
feedin tha pipe might require tha entire stream ta be consumed. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  In
that case, use dis option even if tha stream gotz nuff only one image.
.sp
This option has no effect if you also specify \fB-count\fP.
.sp
Note dat before July 2000, a gangbangin' file could not contain mo' than one
image n' nuff programs ignore all but tha first.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 9.5 (July 2000).

.TP
\fB-comments\fP
This option causes \fBpamfile\fP ta include fo' each PAM image
a report of tha comments from tha header of tha image.
.sp
For a PBM, PGM, or PPM image, \fBpamfile\fP reports there be no
comments, even if there are.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.35 (August 2006).

.TP
\fB-count\fP
This option causes \fBpamfile\fP ta display only a cold-ass lil count of how tha fuck many
images is up in each input file.
.sp
As wit \fB-allimages\fP, dis causes \fBpamfile\fP ta read all the
images.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up wit Netpbm 10.31 (December 2005).
