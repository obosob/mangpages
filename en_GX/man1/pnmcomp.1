.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpnmcomp\fP was obsoleted by
.BR \fBpamcomp\fP (1)
, introduced wit Netpbm 10.21
(March 2004).  \fBpamcomp\fP is backward compatible with
\fBpnmcomp\fP, plus addz nuff additionizzle functions, includin the
abilitizzle ta process PAM images, n' tendz ta produce betta transparency
results.
.PP
\fBpnmcomp\fP remains up in tha Netpbm package cuz it may have
fewer bugs fo' now than \fBpamcomp\fP, n' is up in some environments faster
(but newer compilaz done been peeped ta produce code fo' \fBpamcomp\fP
significantly fasta than dat fo' \fBpnmcomp\fP).  Some day,
\fBpnmcomp\fP will probably become a alias fo' \fBpamcomp\fP.
.PP
Yo ass can use tha \fBpamcomp\fP documentation fo' \fBpnmcomp\fP,
thankin bout tha followin differences:


.IP \(bu
\fBpnmcomp\fP options is a subset of \fBpamcomp\fP's, as
     documented above.
.IP \(bu
\fBpnmcomp\fP always assumes tha input is linear, as \fBpamcomp\fP
     do when you specify its \fB-linear\fP option.
.IP \(bu
\fBpnmcomp\fP cannot process PAM images.
