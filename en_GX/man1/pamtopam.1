pamtopam - copy PAM image

.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpamtopam\fP

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamtopam\fP simply copies a PAM image from Standard Input to
Standard Output.  This may seem a unnecessary duplication of
\fBcat\fP yo, but remember dat a PAM program can read a PBM, PGM, or PPM
image as if it was PAM.  So \fBpamtopam\fP can read either a PBM, PGM,
PPM, or PAM image n' produce a PAM image as output.
.PP
Even dat iz of limited usefulnizz cuz of tha fact dat almost
any program ta which you would feed tha resultin PAM image could also
just take tha original gangsta image directly.  But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat sometimes you straight-up
want a legit PAM image.
.PP
Yo ass can do a mo' general thang of translatin PAM/PNM ta PAM with
\fBpamchannel\fP.
