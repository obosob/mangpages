.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpgmhist\fP readz a PGM image as input n' prints a histogram of the
gray joints or other gray value distribution metrics.
.PP
If you specify none of \fB-median\fP, \fB-quartile\fP, or \fB-decile\fP,
\fBpgmhist\fP prints a cold-ass lil complete histogram showin how tha fuck nuff pixelz of each
possible gray value exist up in tha image.  Along wit each gray value, it tells
you how tha fuck nuff pixels is mo' black n' mo' white dat dat shit.
.PP
\fB-median\fP, \fB-quartile\fP, n' \fB-decile\fP options cause
\fBpgmhist\fP instead ta print tha indicated quantiles.  Each quantile be a
gray value dat straight-up appears up in tha image (as opposed ta fractionizzle joints
that is sometimes used fo' quantiles).  Da 3rd quartile is tha least gray
value fo' which at least 75% of tha pixels is as dark or darker than dat shit.
Da 4th quartile is tha brightest gray value dat appears up in tha image.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS

Yo ass must specify exactly one of tha ramp type options.

.TP
\fB-median\fP
.sp
This option causes \fBpgmhist\fP ta print tha median gray value.
.sp
Yo ass may specify at most one of \fB-median\fP, \fB-quartile\fP, and
\fB-decile\fP.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Neptbm 10.61 (December 2012).

.TP
\fB-quartile\fP
.sp
This option causes \fBpgmhist\fP ta print tha four quartile gray value.
.sp
Yo ass may specify at most one of \fB-median\fP, \fB-quartile\fP, and
\fB-decile\fP.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Neptbm 10.61 (December 2012).

.TP
\fB-decile\fP
.sp
This option causes \fBpgmhist\fP ta print tha ten decile gray value.
.sp
Yo ass may specify at most one of \fB-median\fP, \fB-quartile\fP, and
\fB-decile\fP.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Neptbm 10.61 (December 2012).

.TP
\fB-machine\fP
.sp
This option causes \fBpgmhist\fP ta print tha shiznit up in a way
easily digestible by a machine as opposed ta a human.
.sp
For tha quantiles, there is one line per quantile, up in quantile order, and
it consistz of tha gray value of tha quantile up in decimal wit no leading
zeroes.
.sp
For tha full histogram output, it consistz of one line per possible
gray value (whether dat value appears up in tha image or not), up in order of
the gray joints, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  Da line consistz of two tokens separated by a space.  The
first is tha gray value; tha second is tha number of pixels up in tha image that
have dat gray value.  Both is decimal numbers without leadin zeroes.
