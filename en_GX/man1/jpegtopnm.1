.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBjpegtopnm\fP converts JFIF images ta PPM or PGM images.
.PP
By default, \fBjpegtopnm\fP expects tha input stream ta contain one
JFIF image n' produces one PGM or PPM image as output.  It fails if the
input stream is empty.
.PP
But wit tha \fB-multiple\fP option, \fBjpegtopnm\fP readz JFIF
images sequentially from tha input stream n' writes one PPM or PGM image
to tha output stream fo' each JFIF input.  If tha input stream is empty,
so is tha output.
.PP
Da input stream is tha \fIfilename\fP you specify or, if you
don't specify \fIfilename\fP, Standard Input.  Da output stream is
Standard Output.
.PP
If a JFIF input image iz of tha grayscale variety, \fBjpegtopnm\fP
generates a PGM image.  Otherwise, it generates a PPM image.
.PP
Before Netpbm 10.11 (October 2002), \fBjpegtopnm\fP did not have
the multiple image stream capability.  From 10.11 all up in 10.22,
Netpbm always behaved as if you specified \fB-multiple\fP.  Starting
with Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004), Netpbmz default behavior went back to
the pre-10.11 behavior n' tha freshly smoked up \fB-multiple\fP option selected
the 10.12 behavior. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  Da reason fo' tha reversion was dat there were
discovered up in tha ghetto filez dat contain JFIF images followed by
suttin' other than another JFIF image.  Da ballaz of these files
expect dem ta work wit any JFIF interpreta cuz most JFIF
interpretas just stop readin tha file afta tha straight-up original gangsta JFIF image.
.PP
\fBjpegtopnm\fP uses tha Independent JPEG Groupz JPEG library to
interpret tha input file.  See \fB
.UR http://www.ijg.org
http://www.ijg.org
.UE
\& \fP
for shiznit on tha library.
.PP
\&'JFIF' is tha erect name fo' tha image format commonly
known as 'JPEG.' Strictly bustin lyrics, JPEG be a method of
compression. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Da image format rockin JPEG compression dat is by far
da most thugged-out common is JFIF.  There be also a subformat of TIFF dat uses
JPEG compression.
.PP
EXIF be a image format dat be a subformat of JFIF (to wit, a JFIF
file dat gotz nuff a EXIF header as a APP1 marker).
\fBjpegtopnm\fP handlez EXIF.
.PP
JFIF filez can have either 8 bits per sample or 12 bits per sample.
Da 8 bit variety is by far da most thugged-out common. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  There is two versions
of tha IJG JPEG library.  One readz only 8 bit filez n' tha other
readz only 12 bit files.  Yo ass must link tha appropriate one of these
libraries wit \fBjpegtopnm\fP.  Ordinarily, dis means tha library
is up in yo' shared library search path when you run \fBjpegtopnm\fP.
.PP
\fBjpegtopnm\fP generates output wit either one byte or two bytes
per sample dependin on whether tha JFIF input has either 8 bits or 12
bits per sample.  Yo ass can use \fBpamdepth\fP ta reduce a
two-byte-per-sample file ta a one-byte-per-sample file if you need to.
.PP
If tha JFIF file uses tha CMYK or YCCK color space, tha input do
not straight-up contain enough shiznit ta know what tha fuck color each pixel
is.  To know what tha fuck color a pixel is, one would gotta know the
propertizzlez of tha inks ta which tha color space refers.
\fBjpegtopnm\fP interprets tha flavas rockin tha common transformation
which assumes all tha inks is simply subtractizzle n' linear.
.PP
See the
.BR \fBjpegtopnm\fP manual (1)

for shiznit on how tha fuck images lose qualitizzle when you convert ta and
from JFIF.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS

Da options is only fo' advanced users:

.TP
\fB-dct int\fP
Use integer DCT method (default).

.TP
\fB-dct fast\fP
Use fast integer DCT (less accurate).

.TP
\fB-dct float\fP
Use floating-point DCT method.
Da float method is straight-up slightly mo' accurate than tha int method yo, but is
much slower unless yo' machine has straight-up fast floating-point hardware.  Also
note dat thangs up in dis biatch of tha floating-point method may vary slightly across
machines, while tha integer methodz should give tha same thangs up in dis biatch all over dis biiiatch.
Da fast integer method is much less accurate than tha other two.

.TP
\fB-nosmooth\fP
Use a gangbangin' faster, lower-qualitizzle upsamplin routine.
.TP
\fB-maxmemory\fP\fI N\fP
Set limit on tha amount of memory \fBjpegtopnm\fP uses in
processin big-ass images.  Value is up in thousandz of bytes, or millions
of bytes if 'M' is suffixed ta tha number n' shit.  For example,
\fB-maxmemory 4m\fP selects 4000000 bytes.  If \fBjpegtopnm\fP needs
more space, it uses temporary files.

.TP
\fB-adobe\fP
.TP
\fB-notadobe\fP
There is two variations on tha CMYK (and likewise YCCK) color space that
may be used up in tha JFIF input.  In tha aiiight one, a zero value fo' a cold-ass lil color
components indicates absence of ink.  In tha other, a zero value means the
maximum ink coverage.  Da latta is used by Adobe Photoshop when it creates
a bare JFIF output file (but not when it creates JFIF output as part of
Encapsulated Postscript output).
.sp
These options tell \fBjpegtopnm\fP which version of tha CMYK or
YCCK color space tha image uses.  If you specify neither,
\fBjpegtopnm\fP tries ta figure it up on its own. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  In tha present
version, it don't try straight-up hard at all: It just assumes the
Photoshop version, since Photoshop n' its emulators seem ta be the
main source of CMYK n' YCCK images.  But wit experience of use,
future versions might be mo' sophisticated.
.sp
If tha JFIF image do not indicate dat it is CMYK or YCCK, these
options have no effect.
.sp
If you don't use tha right one of these options, tha symptom is
output dat be lookin like a negative.

.TP
\fB-dumpexif\fP
Print tha interpreted contentz of any Exif header up in tha input
file ta tha Standard Error file.  Similar ta tha program \fBjhead\fP
(not part of tha Netpbm package).
.sp
This option was added up in Netpbm 9.19 (September 2001).
     
.TP
\fB-exif=\fP\fIfilespec\fP
Extract tha contentz of tha EXIF header from tha input image and
write it ta tha file \fIfilespec\fP.  \fIfilespec\fP=\fB-\fP means
write it ta Standard Output.  When you write tha EXIF header to
Standard Output, \fBjpegtopnm\fP do not output tha converted image
(which is what tha fuck normally would git all up in Standard Output) at all.
.sp
\fBjpegtopnm\fP writes tha contentz of tha EXIF header
byte-for-byte, startin wit tha two byte length field (which length
includes dem two bytes).
.sp
Yo ass can use dis file as input ta \fBpnmtojpeg\fP ta bang an
identical EXIF header tha fuck into a freshly smoked up JFIF image.
.sp
If there is no EXIF header, \fBjpegtopnm\fP writes two bytes of
binary zero n' not a god damn thang else.
.sp
An EXIF header takes tha form of a JFIF APP1 marker n' shit.  Only the
first such marker within tha JFIF header counts.
.sp
This option was added up in Netpbm 9.19 (September 2001).

.TP
\fB-multiple\fP
Read multiple JFIF images sequentially from tha input stream.
See 
.UR #description
Description section
.UE
\& fo' details.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).

.TP
\fB-repair\fP
If tha JFIF input is invalid, try ta salvage whatever shiznit is
there n' produce a valid PNM image as output.
.sp
Without dis option, some invalid input causes \fBjpegtopnm\fP
to fail, n' what tha fuck output it produces is undefined. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  With \fB-repair\fP
such invalid input causes \fBjpegtopnm\fP ta succeed instead.
.sp
But note dat there be some formz of invalid input dat always cause
\fBjpegtopnm\fP ta fail n' other than always cause it ta salvage image
information n' succeed.
.sp
One particular case where \fB-repair\fP cook up a gangbangin' finger-lickin' difference is the
common case dat tha file is truncated somewhere afta tha JFIF
header n' shit.  Without \fB-repair\fP, dat always causes a gangbangin' failure; with
\fB-repair\fP it always causes success.  Because tha image
information is laid up generally top ta bottom up in tha JFIF stream,
the image \fBjpegtopnm\fP produces up in dis case has tha proper image
contents all up in tha top yo, but tha bottom is padded wit gray.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.38.0 (March 2007).  Before that,
\fBjpegtopnm\fP always fails up in tha cases up in question.


.TP
\fB-comments\fP
Print any comments up in tha input file ta tha Standard Error file.

.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
Print details bout tha conversion ta tha Standard Error file.

.TP
\fB-tracelevel\fP\fI n\fP
Turn on tha JPEG libraryz trace lyrics ta tha Standard Error
file.  A higher value of \fIn\fP gets mo' trace shiznit.
\fB-verbose\fP implies a trace level of at least 1.



.UN examples
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
This example converts tha color JFIF file foo.jpg ta a PPM file
named foo.ppm:

.nf
    jpegtopnm foo.jpg >foo.ppm
.fi

.UN hints
.SH HINTS

Yo ass can use \fBpnmquant\fP ta color quantize tha result, i.e. to
reduce tha number of distinct flavas up in tha image.  In fact, you may
have ta if you wanna convert tha PPM file ta certain other formats.
\fBppmdither\fP Do a mo' sophisticated quantization.
.PP
Use \fBpamscale\fP ta chizzle tha dimensionz of tha resulting
image.
.PP
Use \fBppmtopgm \fP ta convert a cold-ass lil color JFIF file ta a grayscale
PGM file.
.PP
Yo ass can easily use these convertas together n' shit.  E.g.:

.nf
    jpegtopnm foo.jpg | ppmtopgm | pamscale .25 >foo.pgm
.fi
.PP
\fB-dct fast\fP and/or \fB-nosmooth\fP bust speed at a small
sacrifice up in quality.
.PP
If yo ass is fortunate enough ta have straight-up fast floatin point
hardware, \fB-dct float\fP may be even fasta than \fB-dct fast\fP.
But on most machines \fB-dct float\fP is slower than \fB-dct int\fP;
in dis case it aint worth using, cuz its theoretical accuracy
advantage is too lil' small-ass ta be dope up in practice.
.PP
Another program, \fBdjpeg\fP, is similar. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  \fBdjpeg\fP is
maintained by tha Independent JPEG Group n' packaged wit tha JPEG
library which \fBjpegtopnm\fP uses fo' all its JPEG work.  Because of
that, you may expect it ta exploit mo' current JPEG features.  Also,
since you gotta have tha library ta run \fBjpegtopnm\fP yo, but not
vice versa, \fBcjpeg\fP may be mo' commonly available.
.PP
On tha other hand, \fBdjpeg\fP do not use tha NetPBM libraries
to generate its output, as all tha NetPBM tools such as
\fBjpegtopnm\fP do.  This means it is less likely ta be consistent
with all tha other programs dat deal wit tha NetPBM formats, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  Also,
the command syntax of \fBjpegtopnm\fP is consistent wit dat of the
other Netpbm tools, unlike \fBdjpeg\fP.

.UN environment
.SH ENVIRONMENT


.TP
\fBJPEGMEM\fP
If dis environment variable is set, its value is tha default
memory limit.  Da value is specified as busted lyrics bout fo' the
\fB-maxmemory\fP option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  An explicit \fB-maxmemory \fP option
overrides any \fBJPEGMEM\fP.
