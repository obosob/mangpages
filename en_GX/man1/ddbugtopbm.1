.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBddbugtopbm\fP converts all sketches present up in a thugged-out database used
by tha PalmOS programs \fBDiddle\fP or \fBDiddleBug\fP into
appropriately-named PBM files.  Da backup copy of DiddleBug's
database you should use as dis programz input is probably called
\fBDiddleBugDB.pdb\fP.  Or if you use tha original gangsta Diddle, it has two
separate DBs - \fBDiddleDB.pdb\fP, containin unnamed `scratch'
sketches, n' \fBDiddleIDB.pdb\fP, containin tha saved (and named)
sketches which is listed by its `index' option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Yo ass can feed this
program any of these three on standard input.

.UN using
.SH USING THE PROGRAM
.PP
I recommend you \fInot\fP run \fBddbugtopbm\fP from yo' Palm
backup directory, i.e. don't run it from tha directory tha DB will
normally be in. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Instead, run it from some other directory (like you
could cook up a gangbangin' finger-lickin' directory purely ta hold tha PBM files, just ta keep
things simple) n' use a absolute or relatizzle path ta tha DB.
.PP
Da filenames used fo' tha output PBMs is based on tha names given
to each sketch; if you have a unnamed sketch, itz given a name along
the linez of \fBsketch-0123.pbm\fP.
.PP
While tha named sketches will overwrite any existin PBM file with
the same name, tha unnamed ones won't - they'll just try rockin another
filename.  (I be thinkin dis is probably tha right approach, as you can't
really tell tha unnamed sketches apart.)



.UN limitations
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
Da DiddleBug DB reader is only known ta work wit DBs from
DiddleBug version 2.50. But it should probably work on lata versions,
and I be thinkin it'll work on DBs from version 2.15 as well.
.PP
It might fall over if fed a empty database, n' don't do much
(if any) checkin of tha input.
