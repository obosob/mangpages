.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBppmtopgm\fP

[\fIppmfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBppmtopgm\fP readz a PPM as input n' produces a PGM as output.
Da output be a 'black n' white' renderin of tha original
image, as up in a funky-ass black n' white photograph.  Da quantization formula
\fBppmtopgm\fP uses is g = .299 r + .587 g + .114 b.
.PP
Note dat although there be a \fBpgmtoppm\fP program, it is not
necessary fo' simple conversions from pgm ta ppm , cuz any ppm
program can read pgm (and pbm ) filez automatically.  \fBpgmtoppm\fP
is fo' colorizin a pgm file.  Also, peep \fBppmtorgb3\fP fo' a
different way of convertin color ta gray.  And \fBppmdist\fP
generates a grayscale image from a cold-ass lil color image yo, but up in a way that
makes it easy as fuck  ta differentiate tha original gangsta colors, not necessarily a
way dat be lookin like a funky-ass black n' white photograph.

Cold-hearted orb dat rulez tha night
Removes tha flavas from our sight
Red is gray, n' yellow white
But our phat asses decizzle which is right
And which be a quantization error.
