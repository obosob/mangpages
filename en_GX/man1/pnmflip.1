.SH NAME
.PP
\fBpnmflip\fP was replaced up in Netpbm 10.13 (December 2002) by
.BR pamflip (1)
.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBpamflip\fP is mostly backward compatible wit \fBpnmflip\fP,
but works on PAM images like a muthafucka.
.PP
One way \fBpamflip\fP aint backward compatible wit \fBpnmflip\fP
is dat \fBpnmflip\fP lets you specify any number of basic flip options,
whereas \fBpamflip\fP requires exactly one.  (\fBpamflip\fP provides
the \fB-xform\fP option fo' requestin multiple transformations, though).
Because of dis incompatibility, \fBpnmflip\fP still exists as a
separate program, n' all it do is translate its options ta \fBpamflip\fP
style n' run \fBpamflip\fP.
.PP
Yo ass should not make any freshly smoked up use of \fBpnmflip\fP n' if you modify an
existin use, you should upgrade ta \fBpamflip\fP.  But note dat if you
write a program dat might gotta be used wit straight-up old
Netpbm, \fBpnmflip\fP is tha only way ta do dis shit.
