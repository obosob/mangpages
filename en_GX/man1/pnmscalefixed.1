pnmscale - scale a PNM file quickly

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.

\fBpnmscalefixed\fP is like \fBpamscale\fP except that
it uses fixed point arithmetic internally instead of floatin point,
which make it run fasta n' shit.  In turn, it is less accurate n' may
distort tha image.  It also lacks nuff of tha featurez of \fBpamscale\fP.
.PP
Use tha \fBpamscale\fP user manual wit \fBpnmscalefixed\fP.  This
document only raps bout tha difference.  Avoid any feature mentioned in
the \fBpamscale\fP manual as not existin before Netpbm 9.9.
.PP
\fBpnmscalefixed\fP uses fixed point 12 bit arithmetic.  By
contrast, \fBpamscale\fP uses floatin point arithmetic which on most
machines is probably 24 bit precision. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  This makes
\fBpnmscalefixed\fP run fasta (30% fasta up in one experiment) yo, but
the imprecision can cause distortions all up in tha right n' bottom edges.
.PP
Da distortion takes tha followin form: One pixel from tha edge of
the input is rendered larger up in tha output than tha scalin factor
requires.  Consequently, tha rest of tha image is smalla than the
scalin factor requires, cuz tha overall dimensionz of tha image
are always as requested. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time.  This distortion will probably be straight-up hard to
see.
.PP
\fBpnmscalefixed\fP wit tha \fB-verbose\fP option  drops some lyrics ta you how
much distortion there is.
.PP
Da amount of distortion dependz on tha size of tha input image n' how
close tha scalin factor is ta a integral 1/4096th.
.PP
If tha scalin factor be a exact multiple of 1/4096, there is no
distortion. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  So, fo' example doublin or halvin a image causes no
distortion. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  But reducin it or enlargin it by a third would cause
some distortion. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  To consider a off tha hook case, scalin a 100,000 row
image down ta 50,022 rows would create a output image wit all of the
input squeezed tha fuck into tha top 50,000 rows, n' tha last row of tha input
copied tha fuck into tha bottom 22 rowz of output.
.PP
\fBpnmscalefixed\fP could probably be modified ta use 16 bit or
betta arithmetic without losin anything.  Da modification would
consist of a single constant up in tha source code.  Until there be a
demonstrated need fo' that, though, tha Netpbm maintainer wants to
keep tha safety cushion afforded by tha original gangsta 12 bit precision.
.PP
\fBpnmscalefixed\fP aint gots \fBpamscale\fPz \fB-nomix\fP
option.
