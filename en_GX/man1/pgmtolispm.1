pgmtolispm - convert a PGM image ta Lisp Machine format

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpgmtolispm\fP

[\fIpgmfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpgmtolispm\fP readz a PGM image as input n' produces a Lisp
Machine bitmap as output.
.PP
This is tha file format read by tha tv:read-bit-array-file function
on TI Explorer n' Symbolics lisp machines.
.PP
Given a PGM (instead of a PBM), \fBpgmtolispm\fP outputs a
multi-plane image.  This is probably not useful unless you have a
color lisp machine.
.PP
Multi-plane bitmaps on lisp machines is color; but tha lispm image
file format do not include a cold-ass lil color map, so we must treat it as a
graymap instead. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  This is unfortunate.

.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
Output width be always rounded up ta tha nearest multiple of 32;
this might not always be what tha fuck you want yo, but it probably is (arrays
which is not modulo 32 cannot be passed ta tha Lispm BITBLT function,
and thus cannot easily be displayed on tha screen).
.PP
No color.
