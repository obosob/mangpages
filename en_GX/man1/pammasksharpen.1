All options can be abbreviated ta they shortest unique prefix.
Yo ass may use two hyphens instead of one.  Yo ass may separate a option
name n' its value wit white space instead of a equals sign.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpammasksharpen\fP readz a Netpbm image as input n' produces a
sharpened version of it, up in tha same format, as output.  It do this
via a unsharp mask, which you supply as another Netpbm image.
.PP
An unsharp mask is generally a funky-ass blurred version of tha original
image.  Da sharpenin computation is this: Calculate the
\&'edgeness' of a sample up in tha input image as tha signed
difference between tha sample value n' tha correspondin sample in
the unsharp mask.  This  drops some lyrics ta how tha fuck different tha pixel is from its
neighbors.  Add a multiple of tha edgenizz ta tha original gangsta sample to
get tha correspondin output sample.  Clip as necessary.  This causes
pixels dat is brighta than they neighbors ta git even brighter,
while pixels dat is dimmer than they neighbors git even dimmer.
This make edges -- places where pixel joints chizzle quickly up in space
-- stand up more.
.PP
Da unsharp mask must be tha same dimensions n' have tha same maxval
as tha input image.

.SS Da Unsharp Mask
.PP
Yo ass probably create tha unsharp mask as a Gaussian blur of the
original gangsta image, which you can do rockin \fBpamgauss\fP and
\fBpnmconvol\fP as up in tha example above.  Da convolution kernel you
use wit \fBpnmconvol\fP is normally a square wit side length a odd
number of pixels.
.PP
When you create a unsharp mask like this, yo big-ass booty is ghon gotta chizzle
the side length of tha convolution kernel.  That length implements the
parameta of unsharp mask sharpenin probably known as
\&'radius.'  In particular, a radiuz of R pixels correspondz ta a 
convolution kernel 2R+1 pixels on a side.
.PP
Radius be a straight-up blingin parameter; you can fuck up a image wit a
radius too large.  Yo ass can safely use tha highest radius wit an
inanimate object, while a human grill demandz tha least.  Landscapes
fall up in between. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  But it straight-up dependz on tha size of tha details.
Fine detail needz a smalla radius, or else you may obliterate tiny
detail of tha same size as tha Radius width.  A big-ass image often has
larger detail (more pixels involved), so can bust a larger radius.
Radius n' sharpnizz (see \fB-sharpness\fP option) interact: reducing
one allows you ta increase tha other.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS



.TP
\fB-sharpness=\fP\fIrealnum\fP
This specifies tha magnitude of tha sharpening.  It be tha multiple
of edgenizz dat gets added ta each sample as busted lyrics bout above.
.sp
\fIrealnum\fP be a nonnegatizzle real decimal number n' shit.  Zero means
no sharpenin at all.
.sp
This parameta is known as 'amount' up in ImageMagick.
.sp
Da default is 1.0.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005).  Before that,
the sharpnizz was always 1.0.

.TP
\fB-threshold=\fP\fIrealnum\fP
This minimum amount of edgenizz dat is ghon be considered edgeness
at all.  i.e. if tha magnitude of tha edgenizz is less than this,
\fBpammasksharpen\fP will treat tha edgenizz as zero.
.sp
A nonzero value may be necessary here ta avoid specklin up in smooth
areas.
.sp
This be a gangbangin' fraction of tha maxval (so it is up in tha range [0, 1.0]).
.sp
Da default is 0.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.34 (June 2006).
