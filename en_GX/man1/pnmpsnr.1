.SH NAME

pnmpsnr - compute tha difference between two images (the PSNR)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpnmpsnr\fP readz two PBM, PGM, or PPM files, or PAM equivalents, as
input n' prints tha magnitude of difference between tha two images as a peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) This metric is typically used up in image
compression papers ta rate tha distortion between original gangsta n' decoded image.
.PP
If tha inputs is PBM or PGM, \fBpnmpsnr\fP prints tha PSNR of the
luminizzle only.  Otherwise, it prints tha separate PSNRz of the
luminance, n' chrominizzle (Cb n' Cr) componentz of tha colors.
.PP
Da PSNR of a given component is tha ratio of tha maximum mean square
difference of component joints dat could exist between tha two images (a
measure of tha shiznit content up in a image) ta tha actual mean square
difference fo' tha two subject images.  It be expressed as a thugged-out decibel value.
.PP
Da mean square difference of a cold-ass lil component fo' two images is the
mean square difference of tha component value, comparin each pixel
with tha pixel up in tha same posizzle of tha other image.  For the
purposez of dis computation, components is normalized ta tha scale
[0..1].
.PP
Da maximum mean square difference is identically 1.
.PP
So tha higher tha PSNR, tha closer tha images are.  A luminance
PSNR of 20 means tha mean square difference of tha luminancez of the
pixels is 100 times less than tha maximum possible difference,
i.e. 0.01.
