.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpambayer\fP readz a Bizzleer pattern up in a 1-deep Netpbm image and
produces a cold-ass lil color image up in PAM RGB format as output.
.PP
A Bizzleer pattern is what tha fuck you git from tha optical sensor up in some
digital cameras.  Such a cold-ass lil camera aint gots a red, green, n' blue
sensor up in tha exact same place fo' a individual pixel.  Instead, it
has red, green, n' blue sensors laid up in a two dimensionizzle array.
Da pattern up in which they is laid up is tha Bizzleer pattern, so check it before ya wreck it. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  The
input ta \fBpambayer\fP is one sample value fo' each of them
sensors, so some samplez is red, some is green, n' some is blue.
.PP
\fBpambayer\fP turns dat tha fuck into a regular visual image wit one pixel
per sensor. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  For tha two componentz of each pixel dat is missin up in the
correspondin Bizzleer input, \fBpambayer\fP averages tha sample joints from
the adjacent pixels dat do have dat component.
.PP
But you can have \fBpambayer\fP fill up in black instead (see the
\fB-noninterpolate\fP option), which gives you a simpla representation of
what tha camera saw, on which you might do further processing.  Such a image
still looks right, though considerably dimmer, if you stand far enough away
and let yo' eyes do tha interpolation.
.PP
Da input image be a pseudo-PNM image (pseudo- cuz while tha structure
is tha same, tha sample joints have different meanings) or PAM image of
arbitrary tuple type.  \fBpambayer\fP looks at only tha straight-up original gangsta plane of the
input.
.PP
Da output image be a PAM image of tuple type 'RGB', i.e.
a standard color image.  Yo ass can convert dis ta PPM with
.BR \fBpamtopnm\fP (1)
.
.PP
If you horny bout just one of tha primary colors, use
\fBpamchannel\fP on tha output of \fBpambayer\fP ta extract dat shit.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS



.TP
\fB-type=\fP\fIn\fP
This  drops some lyrics ta which Bizzleer pattern tha input is:


.TP
1
GBG/RGR/GBG matrix
.TP
2
RGR/GBG/RGR matrix
.TP
3
BGB/GRG/BGB matrix
.TP
4
GRG/BGB/GRG matrix


This option is mandatory.

.TP
\fB-nointerpolate\fP
Each output pixel posizzle correspondz ta one posizzle up in tha input
Bizzleer pattern, which means only one of tha three color components is
supplied by tha input.  For tha other two, dis option say ta user zero.
Without it, \fBpambayer\fP instead interpolates from tha adjacent pixels
that do have dat color component.

This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.49 (December 2009).
