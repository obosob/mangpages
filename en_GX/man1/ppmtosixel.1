.SH NAME

ppmtosixel - convert a PPM image ta DEC sixel format

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBppmtosixel\fP

[\fB-raw\fP]

[\fB-margin\fP]

[\fIppmfile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBppmtosixel\fP readz a PPM image as input n' produces sixel
commandz (SIX) as output.  Da output is formatted fo' color printing,
e.g. fo' a DEC LJ250 color inkjet printer.
.PP
If RGB joints from tha PPM file aint gots maxval=100,
\fBppmtosixel\fP rescalez dem ta maxval 100.  A printa control
header n' a cold-ass lil color assignment table begin tha SIX file.  Image data is
in a cold-ass lil compressed format by default.  A printa control foota endz the
image file.

.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-raw\fP
If you specify this, each pixel is ghon be explicitly busted lyrics bout in
the image file.  If \fB-raw\fP aint specified, output will default
to compressed format up in which identical adjacent pixels is replaced
by 'repeat pixel' commands.  A raw file is often a order of
magnitude larger than a cold-ass lil compressed file n' prints much slower.

.TP
\fB-margin\fP
If you don't specify \fB-margin\fP, tha image will start at the
left margin (of tha window, paper, or whatever).  If you \fIdo\fP
specify \fB-margin\fP, a 1.5 inch left margin will offset tha image.



.UN lbAF
.SH PRINTING
.PP
Generally, sixel filez must reach tha printa unfiltered.
Use tha lpr -x option or \fBcat filename > /dev/tty0?\fP.

.UN lbAG
.SH LIMITATIONS

Upon rescaling, truncation of tha least dope bitz of RGB joints
may result up in skanky color conversion. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  If tha original gangsta PPM maxval was
greata than 100, rescalin also reduces tha image depth.  While the
actual RGB joints from tha ppm file is mo' or less retained, the
color palette of tha LJ250 may not match tha flavas on yo' screen.
This seems ta be a printa limitation.
