.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBppmquant\fP is obsolete.  All it do now is invoke
\fBpnmquant\fP or \fBpnmremap\fP.  Yo ass should use one of them
programs up in any freshly smoked up program, or if yo ass is modifyin a oldschool program,
and yo' program do not gotta work wit a version of Netpbm before
9.21 (January 2001).  \fBppmquant\fP exists only fo' name
compatibility.
.PP
\fBpnmquant\fP is straight-up backward compatible wit \fBppmquant\fP
\fIwithout\fP tha \fB-mapfile\fP option; \fBpnmremap\fP is fully
backward compatible wit \fBppmquant\fP \fIwith\fP the
\fB-mapfile\fP option.
.PP
All options can be abbreviated ta they shortest unique prefix.  You
may use two hyphens instead of one ta designate a option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Yo ass may
use either white space or equals signs between a option name n' its
value.
.PP
Except wit differences suggested by tha syntax synopsis above,
\fBppmquant\fPz function is tha same ol' dirty as \fBpnmquant\fP and
\fBpnmremap\fP.
.PP
Before Netpbm 10.19 (November 2003), \fBppmquant\fP was a cold-ass lil straight-up
separate program from \fBpnmquant\fP, n' was a funky-ass bona fide PPM program.
That means if you gave it a PGM or PBM image as input, it would process it
as if it was PPM n' generate a PPM output.  Now, since it is straight-up a
PNM program, it processes PBM n' PGM inputs as what tha fuck they is n' produces
the same kind of output.
.PP
Note: Da reason \fBppmquant\fP was chizzled up in Netpbm 10.19 is
that fo' some time before that, \fBppmquant\fP had a straight-up bug that
would done been hard as fuck ta fix -- it chose tha wack color set.
Maintainin two versionz of tha same code did not make sense.
