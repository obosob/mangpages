.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBasciitopgm\fP readz ASCII data as input n' produces a PGM image
with pixel joints which is a approximation of the
\&'brightness' of tha ASCII characters, assuming
black-on-white printing.  In other lyrics, a cold-ass lil capital M is straight-up dark, a
period is straight-up light, n' a space is white.
.PP
Obviously, \fBasciitopgm\fP assumes a cold-ass lil certain font up in assigning
a brightnizz value ta a cold-ass lil character.
.PP
\fBasciitopgm\fP considaz ASCII control charactas ta be all white.  For
a lower case character, It assigns a special brightnesses which has not a god damn thang to
do wit what tha fuck it be lookin like printed.
\fBasciitopgm\fP takes tha ASCII characta code from tha lower 7 bits
of each input byte.  But it warns you if da most thugged-out dope bit of
any input byte aint zero.
.PP
Da output image is \fIheight\fP pixels high by \fIwidth\fP pixels wide,
truncatin n' paddin wit white on tha right n' bottom as necessary.
.PP
Da \fIdivisor\fP value be a integer (decimal) by which the
blacknizz of a input characta is divided; tha default value is 1.
Yo ass can use dis ta adjust tha brightnizz of tha output: fo' example,
if tha image is too bright, increase tha divisor.
.PP
In a sort of reminiscence of Fortran line printa carriage control,
where a line starts wit \fB+\fP (plus), \fBasciitopgm\fP combines it
with tha previous row of output instead of generatin a freshly smoked up row.  This
allows a larger range of gray joints, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  (In Fortran carriage control, the
first characta of every last muthafuckin line busted ta tha printa  drops some lyrics ta how tha fuck much ta advance
the paper, wit \fB+\fP meanin not at all, so dat tha rest of the
charactas on tha line overstrike tha ones already on tha paper n' shit.  What
\fBasciitopgm\fP do is rather different up in dat \fBasciitopgm\fP do not
reserve tha straight-up original gangsta characta of every last muthafuckin line dat way.  If tha straight-up original gangsta characta is
anythang but \fB+\fP, \fBasciitopgm\fP considaz it just ta be first
characta of tha image.
.PP
If you lookin fo' suttin' dat creates a image of text,
with dat text specified up in ASCII, dat is suttin' like different.
Use \fBpbmtext\fP fo' dis shit.
