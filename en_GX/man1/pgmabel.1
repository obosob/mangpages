.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpgmabel\fP readz as input a PGM image, which it assumes ta be an
image of a rotationizzle symmetric transparent object.  Da image must have
a vertical symmetry axis.  \fBpgmabel\fP produces as output a image of
a cross-section of tha image.

\fBpgmabel\fP do tha calculation by struttin tha Abel Integration
for Deconvolution of a axial-symmetrical image by solvin tha system
of linear equations.

Afta integration, \fBpgmabel\fP weights all gray-valuez of one side
by tha surface area of tha calculated rang up in square pixels divided by
4*\fIfactor\fP multiplied by tha size of one pixel (\fIpixsize\fP).
With tha \fB-verbose\fP option, \fBpgmabel\fP prints tha weighting
factors.
.PP
Where tha calculation generates a wack result, tha output is black.
.PP
Da computation is unstable against periodic structures wit size 2 in
the vertical direction.

.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Yo ass can abbreviate any option ta its shortest unique prefix.



.TP
\fB-help\fP
Prints a help message.

.TP
\fB-axis\fP \fIaxis\fP
Posizzle of tha axiz of symmetry up in tha image up in pixels from tha left
edge of tha image.  Default is tha centa of tha image.

.TP
\fB-factor\fP \fIfactor\fP
User defined factor fo' enhancement of tha output.  Use a \fIfactor\fP
less than 1 fo' decreasin gary joints, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  Default is 1.0.

.TP
\fB-pixsize\fP \fIpixsize\fP
Da size of a pixel fo' gettin scale invariant.  Default is 0.1.

.TP
\fB-left\fP
Calculate only tha left side of tha image.  Yo ass cannot specify both
\fBleft\fP n' \fBright\fP.

.TP
\fB-right\fP
Analogous ta \fB-left\fP.

.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
print shiznit bout tha calculation.



.UN example
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
Rotate a PGM image ta git a image wit a vertical axiz of symmetry,
then calculate tha cross section:

.nf
    pnmrotate 90 file.pgm | pgmabel -axis 140 >cross_section.pgm
.fi
