A program of dis name was freestyled up in 1993 by Ingo Wilken n' was
part of Netpbm until Release 10.34 (April 2006).  At dat time, it was
replaced up in Netpbm by tha current program, which was freestyled by Bryan
Henderson. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Da function of tha newer program is identical ta dat of
the olda one; tha reason fo' tha replacement is dat tha newer one is
easier ta maintain.
