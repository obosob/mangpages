.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Yo ass can abbreviate any option ta its shortest unique prefix.


.TP
\fB-extraskip\fP
This option is ta git round a problem wit some methodz of
transferrin filez from tha Mac ghetto ta tha Unix ghetto. Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  Most of
these methodz leave tha Mac filez alone yo, but all dem of dem add the
\&'finderinfo' data onto tha front of tha Unix file.  This
means a extra 128 bytes ta skip over when readin tha file.  The
symptom ta peep fo' is dat tha resultin PBM file looks shifted to
one side.  If you git this, try \fB-extraskip\fP 128, n' if that
still don't look right try another value.
