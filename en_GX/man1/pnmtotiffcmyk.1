.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpnmtotiffcmyk\fPreadz a PNM image as input n' produces a CMYK
encoded TIFF file as output.  It optionally modifies tha color
balizzle n' black level, n' modifies removal of CMY from under K.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Da order of most options aint blingin yo, but options fo' particular
conversion algorithms must step tha fuck up afta tha algorithm is selected
(\fB-default\fP,\fB-negative\fP).  If you don't select a algorithm,
\fBpnmtotiffcmyk\fP assumes \fB-default\fP n' tha appropriate
options (\fB-theta\fP,\fB-gamma\fP,\fB-gammap\fP) can appear
anywhere.

.SS \fB-none\fP,\fB-packbits\fP,\fB-lzw\fP,\fB-predictor\fP
.PP
Tiff filez can be compressed. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  By default, \fBpnmtotiffcmyk\fP
uses LZW decompression yo, but (apparently) some readaz cannot read
this, so you may wanna select a gangbangin' finger-lickin' different algorithm
(\fB-none\fP,\fB-packbits\fP).  For LZW compression, a
\fB-predictor\fP value of 2 forces horizontal differencin of
scanlines before encoding; a value of 1 forces no differencing.

.SS \fB-msb2lsb\fP,\fB-lsb2msb\fP
.PP
These options control fill order (default is \fB-msb2lsb\fP).

.SS \fB-rowsperstrip\fP
.PP
This sets tha number of rows up in a image strip (data up in tha Tiff
filez generated by dis program is stored up in strips - each strip is
compressed individually).  Da default gives a strip size of no more
than 8 kb.

.SS \fB-lowdotrange\fP,\fB-highdotrange\fP
.PP
These options set tag joints dat may be useful fo' printers.

.SS \fB-knormal\fP,\fB-kremove\fP,\fB-konly\fP
.PP
These options control tha calculation of tha CMYK ink levels.
They is useful only fo' testin n' debuggin tha code.
.PP
\fB-kremove\fP sets tha black (K) levels ta zero while leavin the
other ink levels as they would be if tha black level was normal.
.PP
\fB-konly\fP sets all inks ta tha aiiight black value.

.SS \fB-default\fP,\fB-negative\fP
.PP
These options control what tha fuck ink levels \fBpnmtotiffcmyk\fP uses to
represent each input color.
.PP
\fB-negative\fP selects a simple algorithm dat generates a cold-ass lil color
negative.  None of tha followin options apply ta dis algorithm.  The
algorithm is included as a example up in tha source code ta help
implementorz of other conversions.
.PP
\fB-default\fP aint necessary, unless you gotta countermand a
\fB-negative\fP on tha same command line.  
.PP
Da default conversion from RGB ta CMYK be as bigs up: Da basic
valuez of tha 3 pigments is C = 1-R, M = 1-G, Y = 1-B.  From this,
\fBpnmtotiffcmyk\fP chizzlez a funky-ass black (K) level which is tha minimum of
those three.  It then replaces dat much of tha 3 pigments wit the
black.  I.e. it subtracts K from each of tha basic C, M, n' Y
values.
.PP
Da options below modify dis conversion.

.SS \fB-theta\fP \fIdeg\fP
.PP
\fB-theta\fP serves up a simple erection fo' any color bias that
may occur up in tha printed image cuz, up in practice, inks do not
exactly complement tha primary colors.  It rotates tha flavas (before
black replacement) by \fIdeg\fP degrees up in tha color wheel.  Unless
yo ass is tryin ta produce unusual effects yo big-ass booty is ghon need ta use small
values.  Try generatin three images at -10, 0 (the default) n' 10
degrees n' peep which has tha dopest color balance.

.SS \fB-gamma\fP \fIn\fP
.PP
\fB-gamma\fP applies a gamma erection ta tha black (K) value
busted lyrics bout above.  Specifically, instead of calculatin tha K value as
min(C,M,Y), \fBpnmtotiffcmyk\fP raises dat value (normalised ta the
range 0 ta 1) ta tha \fIn\fPth juice n' shit.  In practice, dis means dat a
value pimped outa than 1 make tha image lighta n' a value less than 1
makes tha image darker n' shit.  Da range of allowed joints is 0.1 ta 10.

.SS \fB-gammap\fP \fIn\fP
.PP
This option controls tha black replacement.
.PP
If you specify \fB-gammap\fP, \fBpnmtotiffcmyk\fP uses tha specified
gamma value up in computin how tha fuck much ink ta remove from tha 3 pigments yo, but
still uses tha regular gamma value (\fB-gamma\fP option) ta generate the
actual amount of black ink wit which ta replace dat shit.
.PP
Valuez of \fIn\fP from 0.01 ta 10 is valid.
.PP
For example, it may be dopest ta only subtract black from the
colored inks up in tha straight-up darkest regions.  In dat case, \fIn\fP
should be a big-ass value, like fuckin 5.
.PP
As a special case, if \fIn\fP is -1, \fBpnmtotiffcmyk\fP do not
remove any pigment (but still addz tha black ink).  This means dark
areas is even darker n' shit.  Furthermore, when printed, dark areas contain
a shitload of ink which can make high contrast areas, like lettering,
appear fuzzy.  It aint nuthin but hard ta peep what tha fuck tha utilitizzle of dis is.
