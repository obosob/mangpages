.PP
Exit wit tha status determined by EXPRESSION.
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display dis help n' exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version shiznit n' exit
.PP
An omitted EXPRESSION defaults ta false.  Otherwise,
EXPRESSION is legit or false n' sets exit status.  It be one of:
.TP
( EXPRESSION )
EXPRESSION is true
.TP
! EXPRESSION
EXPRESSION is false
.TP
EXPRESSION1 \fB\-a\fR EXPRESSION2
both EXPRESSION1 n' EXPRESSION2 is true
.TP
EXPRESSION1 \fB\-o\fR EXPRESSION2
either EXPRESSION1 or EXPRESSION2 is true
.TP
\fB\-n\fR STRING
the length of STRING is nonzero
.TP
STRING
equivalent ta \fB\-n\fR STRING
.TP
\fB\-z\fR STRING
the length of STRING is zero
.TP
STRING1 = STRING2
the strings is equal
.TP
STRING1 != STRING2
the strings is not equal
.TP
INTEGER1 \fB\-eq\fR INTEGER2
INTEGER1 is equal ta INTEGER2
.TP
INTEGER1 \fB\-ge\fR INTEGER2
INTEGER1 is pimped outa than or equal ta INTEGER2
.TP
INTEGER1 \fB\-gt\fR INTEGER2
INTEGER1 is pimped outa than INTEGER2
.TP
INTEGER1 \fB\-le\fR INTEGER2
INTEGER1 is less than or equal ta INTEGER2
.TP
INTEGER1 \fB\-lt\fR INTEGER2
INTEGER1 is less than INTEGER2
.TP
INTEGER1 \fB\-ne\fR INTEGER2
INTEGER1 aint equal ta INTEGER2
.TP
FILE1 \fB\-ef\fR FILE2
FILE1 n' FILE2 have tha same thang n' inode numbers
.TP
FILE1 \fB\-nt\fR FILE2
FILE1 is newer (modification date) than FILE2
.TP
FILE1 \fB\-ot\fR FILE2
FILE1 is olda than FILE2
.TP
\fB\-b\fR FILE
FILE exists n' is block special
.TP
\fB\-c\fR FILE
FILE exists n' is characta special
.TP
\fB\-d\fR FILE
FILE exists n' be a gangbangin' finger-lickin' directory
.TP
\fB\-e\fR FILE
FILE exists
.TP
\fB\-f\fR FILE
FILE exists n' be a regular file
.TP
\fB\-g\fR FILE
FILE exists n' is set\-group\-ID
.TP
\fB\-G\fR FILE
FILE exists n' is owned by tha effectizzle crew ID
.TP
\fB\-h\fR FILE
FILE exists n' be a symbolic link (same as \fB\-L\fR)
.TP
\fB\-k\fR FILE
FILE exists n' has its sticky bit set
.TP
\fB\-L\fR FILE
FILE exists n' be a symbolic link (same as \fB\-h\fR)
.TP
\fB\-O\fR FILE
FILE exists n' is owned by tha effectizzle user ID
.TP
\fB\-p\fR FILE
FILE exists n' be a named pipe
.TP
\fB\-r\fR FILE
FILE exists n' read permission is granted
.TP
\fB\-s\fR FILE
FILE exists n' has a size pimped outa than zero
.TP
\fB\-S\fR FILE
FILE exists n' be a socket
.TP
\fB\-t\fR FD
file descriptor FD is opened on a terminal
.TP
\fB\-u\fR FILE
FILE exists n' its set\-user\-ID bit is set
.TP
\fB\-w\fR FILE
FILE exists n' write permission is granted
.TP
\fB\-x\fR FILE
FILE exists n' execute (or search) permission is granted
.PP
Except fo' \fB\-h\fR n' \fB\-L\fR, all FILE\-related tests dereference symbolic links.
Beware dat parentheses need ta be escaped (e.g., by backslashes) fo' shells.
INTEGER may also be \fB\-l\fR STRING, which evaluates ta tha length of STRING.
.PP
NOTE: [ honors tha \fB\-\-help\fR n' \fB\-\-version\fR options yo, but test do not.
test treats each of dem as it treats any other nonempty STRING.
.PP
NOTE: yo' shell may have its own version of test and/or [, which probably supersedes
the version busted lyrics bout here, so peek-a-boo, clear tha way, I be comin' thru fo'sho.  Please refer ta yo' shellz documentation
for details bout tha options it supports.
