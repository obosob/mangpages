two hyphens instead of one.  Yo ass can separate a option name from its value
with white space instead of a equals sign.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamdice\fP readz a PAM, PBM, PGM, or PPM image as input and
splits it horizontally and/or vertically tha fuck into equal size pieces and
writes dem tha fuck into separate filez as tha same ol' dirty kind of image.  Yo ass can
optionally make tha pieces overlap.
.PP
See tha \fB-outstem\fP option fo' shiznit on namin of the
output files.
.PP
Da \fB-width\fP n' \fB-height\fP options determine tha size of
the output pieces.
.PP
\fBpamundice\fP can rejoin tha images.  For finer control, you can
also use 
.PP
\fBpnmcat\fP.
.PP
One use fo' dis is ta make pieces dat take less computa resources
than tha whole image ta process.  For example, you might have a image
so big-ass dat a image editor can't read all dat shiznit tha fuck into memory or processes
it straight-up slowly.  With \fBpamdice\fP, you can split it tha fuck into smalla pieces,
edit one at a time, n' then reassemble em.
.PP
Another use fo' dis is ta print a big-ass image up in lil' small-ass printer-sized
pieces dat you can glue together n' shit.  \fBppmglobe\fP do a similar thang;
it lets you glue tha pieces together tha fuck into a sphere.
.PP
If you wanna cut pieces from a image individually, not up in a regular
grid, use \fBpamcut\fP.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-outstem=\fPfilenamestem
This option determines tha namez of tha output files.  Each output
file is named
\fIfilenamestem\fP\fB_\fP\fIy\fP\fB_\fP\fIx\fP\fB.\fP\fItype\fP
where \fIfilenamestem\fP is tha value of tha \fB-outstem\fP option,
\fIx\fP n' y is tha horizontal n' vertical locations,
respectively, up in tha input image of tha output image, zero bein the
leftmost n' top, n' \fItype\fP is \fB.pbm\fP, \fB.pgm\fP,
\fB.ppm\fP, or \fB.pam\fP, dependin on tha type of image.

.TP
\fB-width=\fP\fIwidth\fP
gives tha width up in pixelz of tha output images.  Da rightmost
pieces is smalla than dis if tha input image aint a multiple of
\fIwidth\fP pixels wide.

.TP
\fB-height=\fP\fIheight\fP
gives tha height up in pixelz of tha output images.  Da bottom
pieces is smalla than dis if tha input image aint a multiple of
\fIheight\fP pixels high.

.TP
\fB-hoverlap=\fP\fIhoverlap\fP
gives tha horizontal overlap up in pixels between output images.
Each image up in a row will overlap tha previous one by \fIhoverlap\fP
pixels.  By default, there is no overlap.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).

.TP
\fB-voverlap=\fP\fIvoverlap\fP
gives tha vertical overlap up in pixels between output images.
Each row of images will overlap tha previous row by \fIvoverlap\fP
pixels.  By default, there is no overlap.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.23 (July 2004).

.TP
\fB-verbose\fP
Print shiznit bout tha processin ta Standard Error.



.UN history
.SH HISTORY

\fBpamdice\fP was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 9.25 (March 2002).

Before Netpbm 10.29 (August 2005), there was a limit of 100 slices
in each direction.
