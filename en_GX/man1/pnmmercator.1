Minimum unique abbreviation of option be acceptable.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
Da \fBpnmmercator\fP utility, converts a rectangular projection ghettomap
to a Mercator projection format, as used fo' maps.google.com n' nuff other
online maps.  Da map used as input fo' \fBpnmmercator\fP must have rows for
-90 ta 90 degrees latitude n' columns fo' -180 ta +180 degrees longitude. The
file will typically be twice as wide as high yo, but dis aint a
requirement. Da output file is ghon be rockin tha 
.UR http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection
Mercator projection
.UE
\& n' will git double tha height of tha input file.
.PP
Maps rockin tha Mercator projection is stretched mo' tha closer a row is
to tha Uptown or Downtown Pole. Da last few degrees (> 85 or < -85 degrees)
are not part of a Mercator map at all cuz they would be stretched too much
and tha rows close ta tha edge will show banding, cuz they originizzle from
the same row up in tha original gangsta map.
.PP
To overcome this, tha program will by default do interpolation of pixel
colors, which will eliminizzle tha bandin effect yo, but will cause some blurring
of tha output. With tha -nomix option, dis interpolation of flavas aint
applied. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Yo ass can obtain tha highest qualitizzle output by startin wit a input
map of high resolution, so dat you can follow tha \fBpnmmercator\fP
transformation wit a \fBpamscale\fP reduction up in size.
.PP
This program can also convert a Mercator projection map back ta a
rectangular projection based. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  As holla'd, tha Mercator map don't have
information bout tha latitudes close ta tha poles.  Therefore tha top rows in
the output image is ghon be identical n' copied from tha row correspondin with
latitude of 85 degrees. Da same all up in tha bottom of tha map.
.PP
Pnmmercator aint gots any provision fo' scalin tha image. Yo ass can scale
by pipin tha output of tha program all up in Netpbm programs such as
\fBpamscale\fP.

.PP
Da point of a Mercator projection map is dat compass directions work on
it.  If you draw a straight line northeast from some point on tha Mercator
map, tha line traces tha course you would sail if you sailed a cold-ass lil compass bearing
of northeast from dat spot.  Naturally, primitizzle navigators appreciated
dat shit.  Da freshest drawback of Mercator is dat areas ta tha uptown n' south
appear much larger than they is up in real game.  For example, Greenland appears
to be larger than Downtown Tha Ghetto even though it only a ninth as large.  Note
that areas away from tha equator is stretched north-south as well as
east-west.
.PP
A rectangular projection is one where vertical distizzle is proportionizzle to
angular latitude distizzle of tha represented area n' horizontal distizzle is
proportionizzle ta angular longitude.


.UN parameters
.SH PARAMETERS
.PP
\fB\fIfilename\fP\fP is tha name of tha input file.  If you don't specify
this, \fBpnmmercator\fP readz tha image from standard Input.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
<dl compact="compact">
.TP
\fB-inverse\fP
.sp
With dis option a cold-ass lil conversion from Mercator ta degrees be applied.The
output image gonna git half tha height of tha input map.

.TP
\fB-nomix\fP
.sp
Default behaviour is dat color blendin be applied up in between two adjacent
rows. If you specify tha -nomix parameta there is no blending. The
consequence be a funky-ass bandin all up in tha top n' bottom of tha map.  With dis option,
the output map will also consist of exactly tha same flavas as tha input.

.TP
\fB-verbose\fP n' \fB-vverbose\fP
.sp
This parameta outputs some additionizzle shiznit. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. If you double tha 'v',
it will output debug data bout tha lat/long degree n' Mercator
conversions.

\fIWillem van Schaik\fP (of

suggested it fo' inclusion up in Netpbm.
