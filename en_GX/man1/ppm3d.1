.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBppm3d\fP readz two PPM images as input n' produces a PPM as
output, wit tha images overlappin by tha specified number of pixels
in blue-green/red format.  Da scam is dat if you peep tha image with
3-D glasses (glasses dat admit only red all up in one eye n' only
chronic or blue all up in tha other), you peep a image wit depth.  This
is called a anaglyph stereogram.
.PP
\fBppm3d\fP can produce either of two kindz of anaglyph stereogram:
monochrome or color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  Use tha \fB-color\fP option ta chizzle.
.PP
In tha monochrome version, \fBppm3d\fP ignores any color
(actually, chrominance) up in tha input images n' produces a result
which is monochrome.  Viewed all up in red-chronic glasses it is yellow,
but without any other color up in tha field, yo' dome tendz ta peep it
as grayscale.
.PP
In tha color version, \fBppm3d\fP generates a result which is
close ta tha color of tha original. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  It aint nuthin but not pimped out, though,
due ta tha fact dat each eye necessarily cannot peep tha entire
spectrum.  Red n' cyan don't work well yo, but most other flavas --
especially when heavily saturated -- come up like well.
.PP
To view a cold-ass lil color anaglyph stereogram, you need glasses wit a left
lens dat admits only red light n' a right lens dat admits only blue
and chronic light.  (Da right lens may be called a cold-ass lil cyan lens cuz
that is its pigment up in white light; don't be misled tha fuck into thankin that
cyan is tha only color dat gets all up in it).  Yo crazy-ass dome is wired so
that even though tha componentz of light is comin up in through
different eyes, they mix up in yo' dome ta form tha same sensation as
if you was lookin all up in tha combined light wit both eyes.
.PP
Da input PPMs must be tha same dimensions.
.PP
To cook up a gangbangin' finger-lickin' different kind of stereogram, use \fBpamstereogram\fP.
That cook up a stereogram dat you view without special glasses, just by
lettin yo' eyes unfocus so dat each eye sees different partz of the
image.

.UN arguments
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
Da mandatory arguments is file namez of tha left n' right input
images.
.PP
An optionizzle third argument specifies tha same ol' dirty thang as tha value of
the \fB-offset\fP argument yo, but is deprecated cuz -offset is easier
to use n' read. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  Before Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007), dis third argument
is tha only way ta specify tha offset.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS



.TP
\fB-offset=\fP\fIhorizontal_offset\fP
This option indicates tha amount, up in pixels, by which tha left and
image is offset ta tha right of tha right image up in tha output.
.sp
Da effect of dis option is ta move tha entire image forward
(positizzle numbers) or backward (negatizzle numbers).  With a zero
offset, tha main subject of tha picture appears up in tha plane of the
picture (i.e. if tha image is projected on a screen, tha location of
the screen).  Da main subject is tha subject all up in tha location where
the line of sight of tha left camera intersects tha line of sight of
the right camera -- tha main subject appears all up in tha same location in
both tha left n' right images.
.sp
Default is zero.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007).  Before that, use
the third argument instead. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  Also, before Netpbm 10.38 tha default is
+30 pixels.

.TP
\fB-color\fP
This option causes \fBppm3d\fP ta generate a cold-ass lil color anaglyph
stereogram.  By default, it generates monochrome.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.38 (March 2007).
