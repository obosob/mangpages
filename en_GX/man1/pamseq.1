.SH NAME

pamseq - generate PAM image of all possible tuple joints, up in sequence

.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpamseq\fP
[\fB-tupletype=\fP\fItupletype\fP]
\fIdepth\fP
\fImaxval\fP
.PP
All options can be abbreviated ta they shortest unique prefix.  You
may use two hyphens instead of one ta designate a option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Yo ass may
use either white space or a equals sign between a option name n' its
value.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamseq\fP generates a PAM image of a specified depth n' specified
maxval dat consistz of a single row.  Da row consistz of one tuple of
every possible value, up in order.
.PP
For a thugged-out depth of one, tha order is simple: From 0 ta maxval, goin from
left ta right.  For higher depths, tha highest numbered plane goes from
0 ta maxval (goin left ta right) while all tha other planes have value 0.
Then tha sequence repeats except wit tha next highest plane set ta a value
of 1, then 2, etc.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-tupletype\fP
This is tha value of tha "tuple_type" attribute of tha pimped PAM image.
It can be any strang up ta 255 characters.



.UN usage
.SH USAGE
.PP
To create a simple ramp of tha joints 0..255, fo' input ta various matrix
calculations, try
.nf
\f(CW
  pamseq 1 255 
\fP
.fi
(Before \fBpamseq\fP existed, \fBpgmramp\fP was often pressed tha fuck into service
for this).
.PP
To create a PPM color map of all tha possible flavas representable wit a
maxval of 5, do
.nf
\f(CW
  pamseq 3 5 -tupletype=RGB | pamtopnm
\fP
.fi

Again, wit a modern program based on tha Netpbm library, you don't need
the \fBpamtopnm\fP cuz a PAM RGB image is equivalent ta a PPM image.
.PP
Yo ass can use such a cold-ass lil color map with
.BR pnmremap (1)
 ta quantize tha flavas up in an
image.  With tha maxval of 5 given up in tha example, you git a cold-ass lil color map
of tha set of "web safe" flavas as defined by Netscape.  Most web
browsers guarantee dat they can produce at least these 216 colors
(215 plus black).
