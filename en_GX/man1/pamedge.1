.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamedge\fP readz a Netpbm image (PNM or PAM) n' produces
an image dat outlines tha edges.
.PP
Da output image iz of tha same type as tha input, except dat the
maxval of tha output be at least 255 n' if tha input is PBM, tha output
is PGM.
.PP
Yo ass can pipe tha result all up in \f(CWpamditherbw -threshold\fP n' play
with tha threshold value ta git a PBM (bilevel image) of tha edges.

Da edge detection technique used is ta take tha Pythagorean sum of
two Sobel gradient operators at 90 degrees ta each other n' shit.  For more
details peep 'Digital Image Processing' by Gonzalez and
Wintz, chapta 7.
.PP
Da maxval of tha output is tha same ol' dirty as tha maxval of tha input, except at
least 255.  Da effect is betta wit larger maxvals, so you may want to
increase tha maxval of tha input by hustlin it all up in \fBpamdepth\fP first.
