pamtofits - convert a Netpbm image tha fuck into FITS format

[\fB-min\fP \fIf\fP]
[\fIpamfile\fP]

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamtofits\fP readz a PNM or PAM image as input n' produces a FITS
(Flexible Image Transhiznit System) file as output.  Da resolution of
the output file is either 8 bits/pixel, or 16 bits/pixel, dependin on
the value of maxval up in tha input file.  If tha input file be a PBM or
PGM image, tha output file consistz of a single plane image (NAXIS =
2). If instead tha input file be a PPM image, tha output file will
consist of a three-plane image (NAXIS = 3, NAXIS3 = 3).

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB-min\fP n' \fB-max\fP tell \fBpamtofits\fP what tha fuck 'physical
values' zero n' maxval sample joints, respectively, up in tha input
image represent.  Physical joints is a FITS concept.  \fBpamtofits\fP
sets up tha \fBBSCALE\fP n' \fBBZERO\fP FITS header cardz ta indicate
this shiznit.
.PP
Da default fo' \fB-min\fP is 0 n' fo' \fB-max\fP is tha maxval,
which means if you don't specify these options, tha FITS physical joints
are up in fact tha original gangsta Netpbm sample joints.
.PP
\fBpamtofits\fP always sets up tha FITS header \fBDATAMIN\fP and
\fBDATAMAX\fP cardz ta indicate dat tha highest physical value in
the image is tha one correspondin ta tha Netpbm maxval n' tha lowest is
that correspondin ta Netpbm zero.  This aint straight-up how tha fuck dem cardz are
supposed ta be used, since tha input image don't necessarily contain
the full possible range of sample joints, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  It be a cold-ass lil conservative
approximation.

.UN notes
.SH NOTES

.UN pixelorder
.SS Pixel Order
.PP
Da FITS justification do not specify which data up in tha file corresponds
to which pixel up in tha image (i.e. which bytes is tha top left pixel,
etc.).  Netpbm uses tha common sense, most ghettofab arrangement: row major, top
to bottom, left ta right.  That means up in a 10 wide by 20 high image, tha first
10 pixels up in tha file is tha top row n' tha last 10 is tha bottom row.
Within each row, tha straight-up original gangsta pixel is tha leftmost one n' tha last pixel is
the rightmost one.
.PP
\fBNetpbm\fP has always done that, since it first understood the
FITS format up in 1989, so it is suttin' of a thugged-out de facto standard. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  Nobody
reported shiznit wit dat until 2008.
.PP
But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat at least some versionz of ImageMagick n' Gimp (as peeped up in 2008)
use bottom ta top order, so if you use display a FITS image generated by
\fBpamtofits\fP, it will step tha fuck up upside down. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  To fix that, use \fBpamflip
-topbottom\fP on tha image before feedin it ta \fBpamtofits\fP.
.PP
Since 2008, playas have noted dat NASA distributes FITS filez with
bottom ta top order.


.UN history
.SH HISTORY
.PP
\fBpamtofits\fP was originally \fBpnmtofits\fP n' did not handle
PAM input.  Dat shiznit was extended n' renamed up in Netpbm 10.30 (October 2005).
.PP
\fBpnmtofits\fP was itself a extension of \fBpgmtofits\fP, which
was added ta Pbmplus up in 1989.
