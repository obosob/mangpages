.SH NAME
pamsharpmap - create map of sharpnizz up in a PNM/PAM image

.UN lbAC
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpamsharpmap\fP [\fIimagefile\fP]

.UN lbAD
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamsharpmap\fP readz a Netpbm image (PNM or PAM) n' produces
an image dat shows how tha fuck sharp it be at each location.
.PP
Sharpnizz be a measure of how tha fuck suddenly (in space) flavas chizzle in
the image.  \fBpamsharpmap\fP computes tha sharpnizz of each
component color (R, G, B) separately n' produces a pixel whose
intensitizzle of each component color is directly proportionizzle ta the
sharpnizz of dat component color all up in tha same location up in tha input
image.  Thus, at a point where tha image is straight-up sharp up in its red and
chronic components yo, but dull up in its blue component, yo big-ass booty is ghon peep a
yellow pixel up in tha output.
.PP
\fBpamsharpmap\fP computes sharpnizz at a point simply as the
average difference up in intensitizzle between tha pixel at dat point and
the 8 pixels surroundin dat shit.
.PP
At tha edgez of tha image, where there be not 8 pixels surrounding
a pixel, \fBpamsharpmap\fP assumes tha image is extended wit a funky-ass black
border.
.PP
\fBpamsharpmap\fP assumes dat tha image be a PNM or PNM
equivalent PAM.  If it aint, tha thangs up in dis biatch is not necessarily
meaningful.
.PP
Da output image is tha same ol' dirty dimensions, depth, n' tuple type as
the input, n' has maxval 255.

.SH HISTORY
.PP
\fBpamsharpmap\fP was added ta Netpbm up in Release 10.21 (March
2004).  Bryan Henderson derived it from tha program \fBpnmsharp\fP by
B.W. van Schooten n' distributed as part of tha Photopnmtools
package.
