.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.

\fBppmforge\fP generates three kindz of ``random fractal forgeries,''
the term coined by Slick Rick F. Voss of tha IBM Thomas J. Watson
Research Centa fo' seemingly realistic picturez of natural objects
generated by simple algorithms embodyin randomnizz n' fractal
self-similarity.  Da steez used by \fBppmforge\fP are
essentially dem given by Voss[1], particularly tha technique of
spectral synthesis explained up in mo' detail by Dietmar Saupe[2].
.PP
Da program generates two varietizzlez of pictures: hoodz and
clouds, which is just different renderingz of data generated up in an
identical manner, illustratin tha unitizzle of tha fractal structure of
these straight-up different objects, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  A third type of picture, a starry sky,
is synthesised directly from pseudorandom numbers.
.PP
Da generation of hoodz or cloudz begins wit tha preparation of
an array of random data up in tha frequency domain. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Da size of this
array, tha ``mesh size,'' can be set wit tha \fB-mesh\fP option; the
larger tha mesh tha mo' realistic tha pictures but tha calculation
time n' memory requirement increases as tha square of tha mesh size.
Da fractal dimension, which you can specify wit the
\fB-dimension\fP option, determines tha roughnizz of tha terrain on
the hood or tha scale of detail up in tha clouds.  As tha fractal
dimension is increased, mo' high frequency components is added into
the random mesh.
.PP
Once tha mesh is generated, a inverse two dimensionizzle Fourier
transform is performed upon dat shit.  This converts tha original gangsta random
frequency domain data tha fuck into spatial amplitudes.  We scale tha real
components dat result from tha Fourier transform tha fuck into numbers from 0
to 1 associated wit each point on tha mesh.  Yo ass can further modify
this number by applyin a ``power law scale'' ta it wit the
\fB-power\fP option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Unitizzle scale leaves tha numbers unmodified; a
power scale of 0.5 takes tha square root of tha numbers up in tha mesh,
while a juice scale of 3 replaces tha numbers up in tha mesh wit their
cubes.  Juice law scalin is dopest envisioned by thankin of tha data
as representin tha elevation of terrain; powers less than 1 yield
landscapes wit vertical scarps dat be lookin like glacially-carved
valleys; powers pimped outa than one make fairy-castle spires (which
require big-ass mesh sizes n' high resolution fo' dopest thangs up in dis biatch).
.PP
Afta these calculations, our crazy asses gotz a array of tha specified size
containin numbers dat range from 0 ta 1.  \fBppmforge\fP generates
as bigs up:
.PP
Da randomnizz up in tha image is limited before Netpbm 10.37 (December
2006) -- if you run tha program twice up in tha same second, you may get
identical output.


.TP
\fBClouds\fP
A color map is pimped dat ranges from pure blue ta white by
increasin admixture (desaturation) of blue wit white.  Numbers less
than 0.5 is colored blue, numbers between 0.5 n' 1.0 is colored
with correspondin levelz of white, wit 1.0 bein pure white.

.TP
\fBPlanet\fP
Da mesh is projected onto a sphere, so peek-a-boo, clear tha way, I be comin' thru fo'sho.  Values less than 0.5 is treated
as wata n' joints between 0.5 n' 1.0 as land. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  Da wata areas are
colored based upon tha wata depth, n' land based on its elevation.
Da random depth data is used ta create cloudz over tha oceans.  An
atmosphere approximately like tha Earthz is simulated; its light
absorption is calculated ta create a funky-ass blue cast round tha limb of the
planet.  A function dat rises from 0 ta 1 based on latitude is
modulated by tha local elevation ta generate polar ice caps--high
altitude terrain carries glaciers farther from tha pole.  Based on the
posizzle of tha star wit respect ta tha observer, tha apparent color
of each pixel of tha hood is calculated by ray-tracin from tha star
to tha hood ta tha observer n' applyin a lightin model dat sums
ambient light n' diffuse reflection (for most hoodz ambient light
is zero, as they primary star is tha only source of illumination).
Additionizzle random data is used ta generate stars round tha hood.

.TP
\fBNight\fP
A sequence of pseudorandom numbers is used ta generate stars wit a
user specified density.

.PP
Cloud pictures always contain 256 or fewer flavas n' may be
displayed on most color mapped devices without further processing.
Hood pictures often contain tenz of thousandz of flavas which must
be compressed wit \fBpnmquant\fP or \fBppmdither\fP before encoding
in a cold-ass lil color mapped format.  If tha display resolution is high enough,
\fBppmdither\fP generally produces betta lookin hoods.
\fBpnmquant\fP tendz ta create discrete color bands, particularly in
the oceans, which is unrealistic n' distracting.  Da number of
colors up in starry sky pictures generated wit tha \fB-night\fP option
dependz on tha value specified fo' \fB-saturation\fP.  Lil Small-Ass joints
limit tha color temperature distribution of tha stars n' reduce the
number of flavas up in tha image.  If tha \fB-saturation\fP is set to
0, none of tha stars is ghon be colored n' tha resultin image will
never contain mo' than 256 colors.  Night sky pictures wit many
different star flavas often look dopest when color compressed by
\fBpamdepth\fP rather than \fBpnmquant\fP or \fBppmdither\fP.  Try
\fInewmaxval\fP settingz of 63, 31, or 15 wit \fBpamdepth\fP to
reduce tha number of flavas up in tha picture ta 256 or fewer.


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Yo ass can abbreviate any options ta its shortest unique prefix.


.TP
\fB-clouds\fP
Generate clouds.  An image of fractal cloudz is generated. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time.  Selectin clouds
sets tha default fo' fractal dimension ta 2.15 n' juice scale factor
to 0.75.

.TP
\fB-dimension\fP \fIdimen\fP
 Sets tha fractal dimension ta tha specified \fIdimen\fP, which
may be any floatin point value between 0 n' 3.  Higher fractal
dimensions create mo' ``chaotic'' images, which require higher
resolution output n' a larger FFT mesh size ta look good. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! I be fly as a gangbangin' falcon, soarin all up in tha sky dawwwwg!  If no
dimension is specified, 2.4 is used when generatin hoodz n' 2.15
for clouds.

.TP
\fB-glaciers\fP \fIlevel\fP
Da floatin point \fIlevel\fP settin controls tha extent to
which terrain elevation causes ice ta step tha fuck up at lower latitudes.  The
default value of 0.75 make tha polar caps extend toward tha equator
across high terrain n' forms glaciers up in tha highest mountains, as on
Earth.  Higher joints make ice sheets dat cover mo' n' mo' of the
land surface, simulatin hoodz up in tha midst of a ice age.  Lower
values tend ta be boring, resultin up in unrealistic
geometrically-precise ice cap boundaries.

.TP
\fB-hour\fP \fIhour\fP
When generatin a hood, \fBppmforge\fP uses \fIhour\fP as the
\&'hour angle all up in tha central meridian.'  If you specify \fB-hour
12\fP, fo' example, tha hood is ghon be straight-up illuminated,
correspondin ta high noon all up in tha longitude all up in tha centa of the
screen. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Yo ass can specify any floatin point value between 0 n' 24 for
\fIhour\fP yo, but joints which place most of tha hood up in darknizz (0
to 4 n' 20 ta 24) result up in crescents which, while pretty, don't give
you nuff illuminated pixels fo' tha amount of computin that's
required. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  If no \fB-hour\fP option is specified, a random minute angle
is chosen, biased so dat only 25% of tha images generated will be
crescents.

.TP
\fB-ice\fP \fIlevel\fP
Sets tha extent of tha polar ice caps ta tha given floatin point
\fIlevel\fP.  Da default level of 0.4 produces ice caps similar to
those of tha Earth.  Smalla joints reduce tha amount of ice, while
larger \fB-ice\fP settings create mo' prominent ice caps.
Sufficiently big-ass joints, like fuckin 100 or more, up in conjunction with
small settings fo' \fB-glaciers\fP (try 0.1) create 'ice
balls' like Europa.

.TP
\fB-inclination|-tilt\fP \fIangle\fP
Da inclination angle of tha hood wit regard ta its primary
star is set ta \fIangle\fP, which can be any floatin point value
from -90 ta 90.  Da inclination angle can be thought of as
specifying, up in degrees, tha ``season'' tha hood is presently
experiencin or, mo' precisely, tha latitude at which tha star
transits tha zenith at local noon. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  If 0, tha hood be at equinox;
the star is directly overhead all up in tha equator. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  Positizzle joints
represent summer up in tha northern hemisphere, wack joints summer in
the southern hemisphere, so peek-a-boo, clear tha way, I be comin' thru fo'sho.  Da Earthz inclination angle, fo' example,
is bout 23.5 all up in tha June solstice, 0 all up in tha equinoxes up in March and
September, n' -23.5 all up in tha December solstice.  If no inclination
angle is specified, a random value between -21.6 n' 21.6 degrees is
chosen.

.TP
\fB-mesh\fP \fIsize\fP
A mesh of \fIsize\fP by \fIsize\fP is ghon be used fo' tha fast
Fourier transform (FFT).  Note dat memory requirements and
computation speed increase as tha square of \fIsize\fP; if you double
the mesh size, tha program will use four times tha memory n' run four
times as long.  Da default mesh is 256x256, which produces reasonably
phat lookin pictures while rockin half a megabyte fo' tha 256x256
array of single precision complex numbers required by tha FFT.  On
machines wit limited memory capacity, you may gotta reduce tha mesh
size ta avoid hustlin outta RAM.  Increasin tha mesh size produces
betta lookin pictures; tha difference becomes particularly
noticeable when generatin high resolution images wit relatively high
fractal dimensions (between 2.2 n' 3).

.TP
\fB-night\fP
A starry sky is generated. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time.  Da stars is pimped by tha same
algorithm used fo' tha stars dat surround hood pictures yo, but the
output consists exclusively of stars.

.TP
\fB-power\fP \fIfactor\fP
Sets tha 'power factor' used ta scale elevations
synthesised from tha FFT ta \fIfactor\fP, which can be any floating
point number pimped outa than zero.  If no factor is specified a thugged-out default
of 1.2 is used if a hood is bein generated, or 0.75 if cloudz are
selected by tha \fB-clouds\fP option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Da result of tha FFT image
synthesis be a array of elevation joints between 0 n' 1.  A
non-unitizzle juice factor exponentiates each of these elevations ta the
specified juice n' shit.  For example, a juice factor of 2 squares each value,
while a juice factor of 0.5 replaces each wit its square root.  (Note
that exponentiatin joints between 0 n' 1 yieldz joints dat remain
within dat range.)  Juice factors less than 1 emphasise large-scale
elevation chizzlez all up in tha expense of lil' small-ass variations.  Juice factors
greata than 1 increase tha roughnizz of tha terrain and, like high
fractal dimensions, may require a larger FFT mesh size and/or higher
screen resolution ta look good.

.TP
\fB-saturation\fP \fIsat\fP
Controls tha degree of color saturation of tha stars dat surround
planet pictures n' fill starry skies pimped wit tha \fB-night\fP
option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Da default value of 125 creates stars which resemble tha sky
as peeped by tha human eye from Earthz surface.  Stars is dim; only
the brightest activate tha cones up in tha human retina, causin color to
be perceived. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  Higher jointz of \fIsat\fP approximate tha appearance
of stars from Ghetto orbit, where betta dark adaptation, absence of
skyglow, n' tha concentration of light from a given star onto a
smalla area of tha retina props ta tha lack of atmospheric
turbulence enhances tha perception of color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  Values pimped outa than 250
create ``science fiction'' skies that, while pretty, don't occur in
this universe.
.sp
Thanks ta tha inverse square law combined wit Naturez ludd of
mediocrity, there be many, nuff dim stars fo' every last muthafuckin bright one.  This
population relationshizzle be accurately reflected up in tha skies pimped
by \fBppmforge\fP.  Dim, low mass stars live much longer than bright
massive stars, consequently there be nuff reddish stars fo' every
blue giant.  This relationshizzle is preserved by \fBppmforge\fP.  You
can reverse tha proportion, simulatin tha sky as peeped up in a starburst
galaxy, by specifyin a wack \fIsat\fP value.

.TP
\fB-seed\fP \fInum\fP
Sets tha seed fo' tha random number generator ta tha integer
\fInum\fP.  Da seed used ta create each picture is displayed on
standard output (unless suppressed wit tha \fB-quiet\fP option).
Pictures generated wit tha same seed is ghon be identical. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  If no
\fB-seed\fP is specified, a random seed derived from tha date and
time is ghon be chosen. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Specifyin a explicit seed allows you to
re-render a picture you particularly like at a higher resolution or
with different viewin parameters.

.TP
\fB-stars\fP \fIfraction\fP
Specifies tha cementage of pixels, up in tenthz of a cement, which
will step tha fuck up as stars, either surroundin a hood or fillin the
entire frame if \fB-night\fP is specified. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  Da default
\fIfraction\fP is 100.

.TP
\fB-xsize|-width\fP\fI width\fP
Sets tha width of tha generated image ta \fIwidth\fP pixels.  The
default width is 256 pixels.  Images must be at least as wide as they
are high; if a width less than tha height is specified, it will be
increased ta equal tha height.  If you must gotz a long-ass skinny image,
make a square one wit \fBppmforge\fP, then use \fBpamcut\fP to
extract a portion of tha shape n' size you require.

.TP
\fB-ysize|-height\fP \fIheight\fP
Sets tha height of tha generated image ta \fIheight\fP pixels.
Da default height is 256 pixels.  If tha height specified exceedz the
width, tha width is ghon be increased ta equal tha height.



.UN limitations
.SH LIMITATIONS
.PP
Da algorithms require tha output image ta be at least as wide as
it is high, n' tha width ta be a even number of pixels.  These
constraints is enforced by increasin tha size of tha requested
image if necessary.
.PP
Yo ass may gotta reduce tha FFT mesh size on machines wit 16 bit
integers n' segmented pointa architectures.
