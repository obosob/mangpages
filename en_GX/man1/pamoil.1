.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamoil\fP readz a Netpbm image as input n' do a 'oil
transfer', n' writes tha same ol' dirty type of Netpbm image as output.
.PP
Da oil transfer is busted lyrics bout up in 'Beyond Photography' by
Holzmann, chapta 4, photo 7.  It aint nuthin but a sort of localized smearing.
.PP
Da smearin works like this: First, assume a grayscale image.  For
each pixel up in tha image, \fBpamoil\fP looks at a square hood
around dat shit.  \fBpamoil\fP determines what tha fuck is da most thugged-out common pixel
intensitizzle up in tha hood, n' puts a pixel of dat intensitizzle into
the output up in tha same posizzle as tha input pixel.
.PP
For color images, or any arbitrary multi-channel image,
\fBpamoil\fP computes each channel (e.g. red, green, n' blue)
separately tha same way as tha grayscale case above.
.PP
At tha edgez of tha image, where tha regular hood would run
off tha edge of tha image, \fBpamoil\fP uses a cold-ass lil clipped hood.
