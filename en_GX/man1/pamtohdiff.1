pamtohdiff - convert PAM image ta horizontal difference image

.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBpamtohdiff\fP
[\fIpamfile\fP]
[\fB-verbose\fP]
.PP
Minimum unique abbreviation of option be acceptable.  Yo ass may use double
hyphens instead of single hyphens ta denote options.  Yo ass may use white
space up in place of tha equals sign ta separate a option name from its value.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpamtohdiff\fP takes a PAM (or PNM) image as input n' produced a
horizontal difference image version of it as output.  A horizontal
difference image is one where tha samplez up in each row indicate the
difference between tha sample value up in tha correspondin sample of the
input image n' tha sample directly above it (in tha previous row) in
the input image.  Da horizontal difference image has tha property
that if a row of tha original gangsta image is identical ta tha row above it
over a long-ass extent, tha correspondin row up in tha horizontal difference
image will contain all zeroes.  That make it compress betta than the
original gangsta image.
.PP
Because tha horizontal difference samplez can be positizzle or
negatizzle yo, but PAM samplez is unsigned integers, tha samplez up in the
horizontal difference image PAM is defined ta be tha difference
modulus tha range of tha input (maxval + 1).  This don't lose any
information, as it might seem, cuz: of tha two differences that
could result up in tha same \fBpamtohdiff\fP output value (e.g. if
maxval is 99, +20 n' -80 would both result up in "20" up in tha output),
only one is possible up in context n' tha other would result, when
reconstructin tha original gangsta image, up in a value less than 0 or pimped outer
than maxval.
.PP
Before tha modulus operation, tha joints \fBpamtohdiff\fP
computes is also biased by half tha maxval. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  This is ta make the
results easier ta inspect visually.  Because of tha bias, you can
display tha \fBpamtohdiff\fP output as if it was a PNM image.  As
long as none of yo' differences is mo' than half tha maxval, large
negatizzle differences show up as dark spots, smalla negative
differences is lighter, zero differences is medium intensity, and
positizzle differences is light.  If you want dis ta work even for
images dat have differences dat exceed half tha maxval, just use
\fBppmdim 50\fP on tha original gangsta image.  To avoid losin shiznit,
though, do a \fBpamdepth\fP ta double tha maxval first.
.PP
Note dat cuz of tha transfer function just busted lyrics about, a 
difference of zero, which is most common, is represented by a PAM sample
value up in tha output of one half tha maxval.
.PP
Da output PAM has a tuple type of "hdiff".
.PP
Yo ass can use \fBhdifftopam\fP ta recover tha original gangsta image from a
horizontal difference image PAM.
