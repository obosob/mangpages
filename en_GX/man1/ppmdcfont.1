.UN synopsis
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBppmdcfont\fP


.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
(There is no arguments or options)
.PP
\fBppmdcfont\fP creates a C source file dat you can compile into
a built-in font fo' use wit tha Netpbm PPM drawin facilities. Put ya muthafuckin choppers up if ya feel dis!  It
readz a Ppmdfont file on Standard Input n' writes tha C source code to
Standard Output.
.PP
Da output C source code has tha font objectz name hardcoded as
\fBppmd_standardfont\fP, which yo big-ass booty is ghon definitely wanna edit,
because dat is tha name of tha font built up in ta \fBlibnetpbm\fP.  If
you don't chizzle it, it will conflict both cognitively n' up in program
linking.  There should obviously be a option on \fBppmdcfont\fP to
choose dis yo, but tha pimpment effort has not been justified so far.
