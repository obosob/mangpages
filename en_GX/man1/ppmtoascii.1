[\fIppmfile\fP]

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBppmtoascii\fP readz a PPM image as input n' produces a somewhat
crude ASCII graphic image as output, wit ANSI terminal control characters
so it has crude color when busted ta a cold-ass lil color text terminal.
.PP
There is no converta fo' tha other direction.
.PP
\fBppmtoterm\fP do a similar thang yo, but displays each characta of the
image as a single pixel (usin tha same dense characta fo' every last muthafuckin pixel),
whereas \fBppmtoascii\fP combines 2 or 8 pixels tha fuck into one character, where
the characta roughly represents dem particular pixels.
.PP
Note dat ANSI serves up fo' only eight flavas (includin black n' white).
.PP
Note dat a ANSI terminal can't display a single characta up in multiple
colors, so where a cold-ass lil characta represents 8 pixelz of differin colors, the
color of tha characta is one dat is tha average of tha flavaz of them
pixels.
.PP
\fBpbmtoascii\fP do tha same thang fo' PBM images, wit no terminal
control charactas (because none is needed fo' a strictly black n' white
image).


.UN options
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
Da \fB-1x2\fP n' \fB-2x4\fP options hit you wit two alternate ways fo' the
pixels ta git mapped ta characters.  With \fB1x2\fP, tha default, each
characta represents a crew of 1 pixel across by 2 pixels down. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  With
\fB-2x4\fP, each characta represents 2 pixels across by 4 pixels down.
