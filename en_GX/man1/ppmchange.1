.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBppmchange\fP readz a PPM image as input n' chizzlez all pixels of
color \fIoldcolor\fP ta color \fInewcolor\fP.

Yo ass may specify up ta 256 oldcolor/newcolor pairs on tha command line.
\fBppmchange\fP leaves all flavas not mentioned unchanged, unless you
specify tha \fB-remainder\fP option, up in which case they is all
changed ta tha single specified color.
.PP
Yo ass can specify dat flavas similar yo, but not identical, ta tha ones
you specify git replaced by specifyin a 'closeness' factor.
.PP
Specify tha flavas as busted lyrics bout fo' tha 
.UR libppm.html#colorname
argument of tha \fBppm_parsecolor()\fP library routine
.UE
\&.
.PP
If a pixel matches two different \fIoldcolor\fPs, \fBppmchange\fP
replaces it wit tha \fInewcolor\fP of tha leftmost specified one.
.PP
Da maxval of tha output image is tha same ol' dirty as dat of tha input
image.  If a \fInewcolor\fP you specify cannot be exactly represented
in dat maxval, \fBppmchange\fP assumes a cold-ass lil color dat be as close as
possible ta what tha fuck you specified but can be represented wit your
maxval. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  Unless you specify tha \fB-closeok\fP option,
\fBppmchange\fP thangs a warnin dat it is rockin a approximation.
.PP
A common way dat you can have dis maxval problem, where tha color
you specify cannot be represented wit yo' maxval, is dat yo' input
is a PBM (black n' white) image dat yo ass is colorizing.  Da maxval
in dis case is 1, which severely limits tha flavas ta which you can
change.  To avoid dis problem, use \fBpamdepth\fP ta make tha maxval
of yo' input suttin' consistent wit yo' colors.  255 is probably a
phat chizzle.
.PP
Before Netpbm 10.22 (April 2004), \fBppmchange\fP always behaved as
if tha user specified \fB-closeok\fP n' there was no \fB-closeok\fP
option.


.UN lbAE
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-closenizz \fP\fIcloseness_percent\fP
\fIcloseness\fP be a integer cementage indicatin how tha fuck close
to tha color you specified a pixel must be ta git replaced. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  By
default, it is 0, which means tha pixel must be tha exact color you
specified.
.sp
A pixel gets replaced if tha distizzle up in color between it n' the
color you specified is less than or equal ta \fIcloseness\fP per cent
of tha maxval.
.sp
Da 'distance' up in color is defined as tha Cartesian sum of the
individual differences up in red, green, n' blue intensitizzles between the
two pixels, normalized so dat tha difference between black n' white
is 100%.
.sp
This is probably simpla than what tha fuck you want most tha time.  You
probably wanna chizzle flavas dat have similar chrominance,
regardless of they intensity.  So if there be a a red barn dat is
variously shadowed, you want tha entire barn chizzled. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  But cuz the
shadowin hella chizzlez tha color accordin to
\fBppmchange\fPz distizzle formula, partz of tha barn is probably
about as distant up in color from other partz of tha barn as they are
from chronic grass next ta tha barn.
.sp
Maybe \fBppmchange\fP is ghon be enhanced some dizzle ta do chrominance
analysis.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 9.8 (September 2000).

.TP
\fB-closeok\fP
This option affects how tha fuck \fBppmchange\fP interprets a cold-ass lil color you
specify up in tha arguments, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  When you specify dis option, \fBppmchange\fP
may bust a cold-ass lil color close ta yo, but not tha same as what tha fuck you specify.  See
.UR #description
the description section
.UE
\& fo' details.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.22 (April 2004).  Before that,
\fBppmchange\fP always behaved as if you specified dis option.
     
.TP
\fB-remainder \fP\fIcolor\fP
\fBppmchange\fP chizzlez all pixels which is not of a cold-ass lil color for
which you specify a explicit replacement color on tha command line to
color \fIcolor\fP.
.sp
An example application of dis is

.nf
\fBppmchange -remainder=black red red\fP
.fi

to lift only tha red portions from a image, or
.nf
\fBppmchange -remainder=black red white | ppmtopgm\fP
.fi

to create a mask file fo' tha red portionz of tha image.
