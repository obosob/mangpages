All options can be abbreviated ta they shortest unique prefix.
Yo ass may use two hyphens instead of one ta designate a option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  You
may use either white space or equals signs between a option name and
its value.

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
\fBpnmshear\fP readz a PNM image as input n' shears it by the
specified angle n' produce a PNM image as output.  If tha input file
is up in color, tha output is ghon be too, otherwise it is ghon be grayscale.
Da angle is up in degrees (floatin point), n' measures this:

.nf
    +-------+  +-------+
    |       |  |\e       \e
    |  OLD  |  | \e  NEW  \e
    |       |  |an\e       \e
    +-------+  |gle+-------+
.fi

If tha angle is negative, it shears tha other way:
.nf
    +-------+  |-an+-------+
    |       |  |gl/       /
    |  OLD  |  |e/  NEW  /
    |       |  |/       /
    +-------+  +-------+
.fi

Da angle should not git too close ta 90 or -90, or tha resulting
image is ghon be unreasonably wide.
.PP
\fBpnmshear\fP do tha shearin by loopin over tha source pixels
and distributin fractions ta each of tha destination pixels.  This
has a 'anti-aliasing' effect - it avoidz jagged edges and
similar artifacts, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat it also means dat tha original gangsta flavas in
the image is modified n' there be typically mo' of dem than you
started with.  If you need ta keep precisely tha same set of colors,
see tha \fB-noantialias\fP option. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  If tha expanded palette be a
problem, you can run tha result all up in \fBpnmquant\fP.

.UN options
.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB-background=\fP\fIcolor\fP
This determines tha color of tha background on which tha sheared image
sits.
.sp
Specify tha color (\fIcolor\fP) as busted lyrics bout fo' tha 
.UR libppm.html#colorname
argument of tha \fBppm_parsecolor()\fP library routine
.UE
\&.
.sp
By default, if you don't specify dis option, \fBpnmshear\fP selects
what appears ta it ta be tha background color of tha original gangsta image.  It 
determines dis color rather simplistically, by takin a average of tha colors
of tha two top cornerz of tha image.
.sp
This option was freshly smoked up in Netpbm 10.37 (December 2006).  Before that,
\fBpnmshear\fP always behaved as is tha default now, nahmeean?

.TP
\fB-noantialias\fP
This option forces \fBpnmrotate\fP ta simply move pixels round instead 
of synthesizin output pixels from multiple input pixels.  Da latta could
cause tha output ta contain flavas dat is not up in tha input, which may not
be desirable.  It also probably make tha output contain a big-ass number of
colors.  If you need a lil' small-ass number of colors yo, but it don't matta if they
are tha exact ones from tha input, consider rockin \fBpnmquant\fP on tha 
output instead of rockin \fB-noantialias\fP.
.sp
Note dat ta ensure tha output do not contain flavas dat is not
in tha input, you also must consider tha background color. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  See the
\fB-background\fP option.
