.SH "NAME"
smbpasswd \- Da Samba encrypted password file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
smbpasswd
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This tool is part of the
\fBsamba\fR(7)
suite\&.
.PP
smbpasswd is tha Samba encrypted password file\&. Well shiiiit, it gotz nuff tha username, Unix user id n' tha SMB hashed passwordz of tha user, as well as account flag shiznit n' tha time tha password was last chizzled\&. This file format has been evolvin wit Samba n' has had nuff muthafuckin different formats up in tha past\&.
.SH "FILE FORMAT"
.PP
Da format of tha smbpasswd file used by Samba 2\&.2 is straight-up similar ta tha familiar Unix
passwd(5)
file\&. Well shiiiit, it be a ASCII file containin one line fo' each user\&. Each field within each line is separated from tha next by a cold-ass lil colon\& fo' realz. Any entry beginnin wit \*(Aq#\*(Aq is ignored\&. Da smbpasswd file gotz nuff tha followin shiznit fo' each user:
.PP
name
.RS 4
This is tha user name\&. Well shiiiit, it must be a name dat already exists up in tha standard UNIX passwd file\&.
.RE
.PP
uid
.RS 4
This is tha UNIX uid\&. Well shiiiit, it must match tha uid field fo' tha same user entry up in tha standard UNIX passwd file\&. If dis do not match then Samba will refuse ta recognize dis smbpasswd file entry as bein valid fo' a user\&.
.RE
.PP
Lanman Password Hash
.RS 4
This is tha LANMAN hash of tha user\*(Aqs password, encoded as 32 hex digits\&. Da LANMAN hash is pimped by DES encryptin a well known strang wit tha user\*(Aqs password as tha DES key\&. This is tha same ol' dirty password used by Windows 95/98 machines\&. Note dat dis password hash is regarded as weak as it is vulnerable ta doggtionary attacks n' if two playas chizzle tha same password dis entry is ghon be identical (i\&.e\&. tha password aint "salted" as tha UNIX password is)\&. If tha user has a null password dis field will contain tha charactas "NO PASSWORD" as tha start of tha hex string\&. If tha hex strang is equal ta 32 \*(AqX\*(Aq charactas then tha user\*(Aqs account is marked as
\fBdisabled\fR
and tha user aint gonna be able ta log onto tha Samba server\&.
.sp
\fIWARNING !!\fR
Note that, cuz of tha challenge\-response nature of tha SMB/CIFS authentication protocol, mah playas wit a knowledge of dis password hash is ghon be able ta impersonate tha user on tha network\&. For dis reason these hashes is known as
\fIplain text equivalents\fR
and must
\fINOT\fR
be made available ta mah playas but tha root user\&. To protect these passwordz tha smbpasswd file is placed up in a gangbangin' finger-lickin' directory wit read n' traverse access only ta tha root user n' tha smbpasswd file itself must be set ta be read/write only by root, wit no other access\&.
.RE
.PP
NT Password Hash
.RS 4
This is tha Windows NT hash of tha user\*(Aqs password, encoded as 32 hex digits\&. Da Windows NT hash is pimped by takin tha user\*(Aqs password as represented up in 16\-bit, lil\-endian UNICODE n' then applyin tha MD4 (internizzle rfc1321) hashin algorithm ta it\&.
.sp
This password hash is considered mo' secure than tha LANMAN Password Hash as it preserves tha case of tha password n' uses a much higher qualitizzle hashin algorithm\&. But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat it is still tha case dat if two playas chizzle tha same password dis entry is ghon be identical (i\&.e\&. tha password aint "salted" as tha UNIX password is)\&.
.sp
\fIWARNING !!\fR\&. Note that, cuz of tha challenge\-response nature of tha SMB/CIFS authentication protocol, mah playas wit a knowledge of dis password hash is ghon be able ta impersonate tha user on tha network\&. For dis reason these hashes is known as
\fIplain text equivalents\fR
and must
\fINOT\fR
be made available ta mah playas but tha root user\&. To protect these passwordz tha smbpasswd file is placed up in a gangbangin' finger-lickin' directory wit read n' traverse access only ta tha root user n' tha smbpasswd file itself must be set ta be read/write only by root, wit no other access\&.

Account Flags
.RS 4
This section gotz nuff flags dat describe tha attributez of tha playas account\&. This field is bracketed by \*(Aq[\*(Aq n' \*(Aq]\*(Aq charactas n' be always 13 charactas up in length (includin tha \*(Aq[\*(Aq n' \*(Aq]\*(Aq characters)\&. Da contentz of dis field may be any of tha followin characters:

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c

.el \{\
.sp -1

.ie n \{\

.el \{\

\fIN\fR
\- This means tha account has no password (the passwordz up in tha fieldz LANMAN Password Hash n' NT Password Hash is ignored)\&. Note dat dis will only allow playas ta log on wit no password if the
\fI null passwords\fR
parameta is set up in the
\fBsmb.conf\fR(5)
config file\&.

Other flags may be added as tha code is extended up in future\&. Da rest of dis field space is filled up in wit spaces\&. For further shiznit regardin tha flags dat is supported please refer ta tha playa page fo' the

Last Chizzle Time
.RS 4
This field consistz of tha time tha account was last modified\&. Well shiiiit, it consistz of tha charactas \*(AqLCT\-\*(Aq (standin fo' "Last Chizzle Time") followed by a numeric encodin of tha UNIX time up in secondz since tha epoch (1970) dat tha last chizzle was made\&.
.RE

Da original gangsta Samba software n' related utilitizzles was pimped by Andrew Tridgell\&. Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Samba is now pimped by tha Samba Crew as a Open Source project similar ta tha way tha Linux kernel is pimped\&.
.PP
Da original gangsta Samba playa pages was freestyled by Karl Auer\&. Da playa page sources was converted ta YODL format (another pimpin piece of Open Source software, available at
ftp://ftp\&.icce\&.rug\&.nl/pub/unix/) n' updated fo' tha Samba 2\&.0 release by Jeremy Allison\&. Da conversion ta DocBook fo' Samba 2\&.2 was done by Gerald Carter\&. Da conversion ta DocBook XML 4\&.2 fo' Samba 3\&.0 was done by Alexander Bokovoy\&.
