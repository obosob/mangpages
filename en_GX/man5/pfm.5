.TH "PFM Format Description" 5 "19 April 2012" "netpbm documentation"

.SH NAME

PFM - PFM graphic image file format

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This document raps bout tha PFM graphic image file format as understood by
the Netpbm converters
.BR \fBpamtopfm\fP (1)
 and
.BR \fBpfmtopam\fP (1)
.
.PP
There is multiple similar formats known as PFM up in tha ghetto, none
of dem authoritatively documented. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time.  Da format busted lyrics bout here is one
that Bryan Henderson deduced from a program he found somewhere that
dealt wit a 'PFM' format.
.PP
Da PFM format is inspired by tha Netpbm formats, n' yo big-ass booty is ghon see
lotz of similarity.  It be not, however, a straight-up legit Netpbm format.
Its goal aint consistent wit dem of Netpbm formats.

.SH Da format
.PP
A PFM image be a stream of bytes.  Da stream consistz of a header
followed immediately by a rasta n' shit.  These two components is busted lyrics about
below.  There is no delimetas before or afta tha sections as
busted lyrics about.

.SS PFM header
.PP
Da PFM header is 3 consecutizzle 'lines' of ASCII text.
Afta each line be a white space character n' shit.  That characta is
typically a newline character, hence tha term 'line,' but
doesn't gotta be.
.PP
\fBpamtopfm\fP uses a newline up in tha PFM it generates.

.B Identifier Line
.PP
Da identifier line gotz nuff tha charactas 'PF' or
\&'Pf'.  PF means itz a cold-ass lil color PFM.  Pf means itz a grayscale
PFM.

.B Dimensions Line
.PP
Da dimensions line gotz nuff two positizzle decimal integers,
separated by a funky-ass blank.  Da first is tha width of tha image; tha second
is tha height.  Both is up in pixels.

.B Scale Factor / Endianness
.PP
Da Scale Factor / Endiannizz line be a queer line dat jams
endiannizz shiznit tha fuck into a otherwise sane description of a scale.
Da line consistz of a nonzero decimal number, not necessarily an
integer n' shit.  If tha number is negative, dat means tha PFM rasta is
lil endian. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Otherwise, it is big-ass endian. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Da absolute value of
the number is tha scale factor fo' tha image.
.PP
Da scale factor  drops some lyrics ta tha unitz of tha samplez up in tha rasta n' shit.  You
use somehow it along wit some separately understood unit shiznit
to turn a sample value tha fuck into suttin' meaningful, like fuckin watts per
square meter.


.SS PFM raster
.PP
Da rasta be a sequence of pixels, packed one afta another, wit no
delimitaz of any kind. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  They is grouped by row, wit tha pixels up in each
row ordered left ta right n' tha rows ordered bottom ta top.
.PP
Each pixel consistz of 1 or 3 samples, packed one afta another,
with no delimitaz of any kind. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  1 sample fo' a grayscale PFM n' 3 fo' a
color PFM (see tha Identifier Line of tha PFM header).
.PP
Each sample consistz of 4 consecutizzle bytes.  Da bytes represent a
32 bit string, up in either big-ass endian or lil endian format, as determined
by tha Scale Factor / Endiannizz line of tha PFM header n' shit.  That strang is
an IEEE 32 bit floatin point number code.  Since thatz tha same ol' dirty format
that most CPUs n' compila use, you can probably just cook up a program use
the bytes directly as a gangbangin' floatin point number, afta takin care of the
endiannizz variation.
