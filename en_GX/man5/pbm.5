.TH "Da PBM Format" 5 "22 September 2006" "netpbm documentation"

.SH NAME

pbm - Netpbm bi-level image format

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
Da PBM format be a lowest common denominator monochrome file
format.  It serves as tha common language of a big-ass crew of bitmap
image conversion filters.  Because tha format pays no heed to
efficiency, it is simple n' general enough dat one can easily
develop programs ta convert ta n' from just bout any other graphics
format, or ta manipulate tha image.
.PP
Da name "PBM" be a acronym derived from "Portable Bit Map."
.PP
This aint a gangbangin' format dat one would normally use ta store a gangbangin' file
or ta transmit it ta one of mah thugs -- itz too high-rollin' n' not expressive
enough fo' dis shit.  It aint nuthin but just a intermediary format.  In itz purest
use, it lives only up in a pipe between two other programs.
.PP
Da format definizzle be as bigs up.
.PP
A PBM file consistz of a sequence of one or mo' PBM images. There are
no data, delimiters, or paddin before, after, or between images.
.PP
Each PBM image consistz of tha following:



.IP \(bu
A 'magic number' fo' identifyin tha file type.
A pbm imagez magic number is tha two charactas 'P4'.

.IP \(bu
Whitespace (blanks, TABs, CRs, LFs).

.IP \(bu
Da width up in pixelz of tha image, formatted as ASCII charactas up in decimal.

.IP \(bu
Whitespace.

.IP \(bu
Da height up in pixelz of tha image, again n' again n' again up in ASCII decimal.

.IP \(bu
A single whitespace characta (usually a newline).

.IP \(bu
A rasta of Height rows, up in order from top ta bottom.  Each row is
Width bits, packed 8 ta a funky-ass byte, wit couldn't give a fuckin shiznit bits ta fill up the
last byte up in tha row.  Each bit represents a pixel: 1 is black, 0 is
white.  Da order of tha pixels is left ta right.  Da order of their
storage within each file byte is most dope bit ta least
significant bit.  Da order of tha file bytes is from tha beginnin of
the file toward tha end of tha file.
.sp
A row of a image is horizontal. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  A column is vertical. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  Da pixels
in tha image is square n' contiguous.

.IP \(bu
Before tha whitespace characta dat delimits tha raster, any
charactas from a '#' all up in tha next carriage return or
newline character, be a cold-ass lil comment n' is ignored. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  Note dat dis is
rather unconventional, cuz a cold-ass lil comment can straight-up be up in tha middle
of what tha fuck you might consider a token. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Note also dat dis means if you
have a cold-ass lil comment right before tha raster, tha newline all up in tha end of the
comment aint sufficient ta delimit tha raster.


.PP
There is straight-up another version of tha PBM format, even more
simplistic, mo' lavishly wasteful of space than PBM, called Plain
PBM.  Plain PBM straight-up came first yo, but even its inventor couldn't
stand its recklessly squanderous use of resources afta a while and
switched ta what tha fuck we now know as tha regular PBM format.  But Plain PBM
is so redundant -- so overstated -- dat itz virtually impossible to
break.  Yo ass can bust it all up in da most thugged-out liberal mail system (which
was tha original gangsta purpose of tha PBM format) n' it will arrive still
readable.  Yo ass can flip a thugged-out dozen random bits n' easily piece back
together tha original gangsta image.  And our crazy asses hardly need ta define tha format
here, cuz you can decode it by inspection.
.PP
Netpbm programs generate Raw PBM format instead of Plain PBM by
default yo, but tha 
.UR index.html#commonoptions
common option
.UE
\&
\fB-plain\fP chizzlez Plain PBM.
.PP
Da difference is:

.TP
-
There is exactly one image up in a gangbangin' file.
.TP
-
Da 'magic number' is 'P1' instead of 'P4'.
.TP
-
Each pixel up in tha rasta is represented by a funky-ass byte containin ASCII '1' or '0',
representin black n' white respectively.  There is no fill bits at the
end of a row.
.TP
-
White space up in tha rasta section is ignored.
.TP
-
Yo ass can put any junk you want afta tha raster, if it starts wit a 
white space character.
.TP
-
No line should be longer than 70 characters.

.PP
Here be a example of a lil' small-ass image up in tha plain PBM format.

There be a newline characta all up in tha end of each of these lines.
.PP
Yo ass can generate tha Plain PBM format from tha regular PBM format
(first image up in tha file only) wit tha \fBpnmtoplainpnm\fP program.
.PP
Programs dat read dis format should be as lenient as possible,
acceptin anythang dat looks remotely like a funky-ass bitmap.
.PP
All charactas referred ta herein is encoded up in ASCII.
\&'newline' refers tha characta known up in ASCII as Line
Feed or LF.  A 'white space' characta is space, CR, LF,
TAB, VT, or FF (I.e. what tha fuck tha ANSI standard C isspace() function
calls white space).

.UN compatibility
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
Before July 2000, there could be at most one image up in a PBM file.  As
a result, most tools ta process PBM filez ignore (and don't read) any
data afta tha straight-up original gangsta image.
