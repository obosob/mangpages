.SH NAME

PPM - Netpbm color image format

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is part of
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
Da PPM format be a lowest common denominator color image file
format.
.PP
It should be noted dat dis format is egregiously inefficient.
It be highly redundant, while containin a shitload of shiznit dat the
human eye can't even discern, so check it before ya wreck it. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  Furthermore, tha format allows hella
lil shiznit bout tha image besides basic color, which means
you may gotta couple a gangbangin' file up in dis format wit other independent
information ta git any decent use outta dat shit.  But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat it is straight-up easy as fuck 
to write n' analyze programs ta process dis format, n' dat is the
point.
.PP
It should also be noted dat filez often conform ta dis format in
every respect except tha precise semantics of tha sample joints.
These filez is useful cuz of tha way PPM is used as an
intermediary format.  They is informally called PPM filez yo, but ta be
straight-up precise, you should indicate tha variation from legit PPM.
For example, 'PPM rockin tha red, green, n' blue flavas dat the
scanner up in question uses.'
.PP
Da name "PPM" be a acronym derived from "Portable Pixel Map."
Images up in dis format (or a precursor of it) was once also called
"portable pixmaps."
.PP
Da format definizzle be as bigs up.  Yo ass can use the
.BR libnetpbm (1)
 C subroutine library ta read and
interpret tha format conveniently n' accurately.
.PP
A PPM file consistz of a sequence of one or mo' PPM images. There are
no data, delimiters, or paddin before, after, or between images.
.PP
Each PPM image consistz of tha following:


.IP \(bu
A 'magic number' fo' identifyin tha file type.
A ppm imagez magic number is tha two charactas 'P6'.
.IP \(bu

Whitespace (blanks, TABs, CRs, LFs).
.IP \(bu

A width, formatted as ASCII charactas up in decimal.
.IP \(bu

Whitespace.
.IP \(bu

A height, again n' again n' again up in ASCII decimal.
.IP \(bu

Whitespace.
.IP \(bu

Da maximum color value (Maxval), again n' again n' again up in ASCII decimal. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  Must be less
than 65536 n' mo' than zero.

.IP \(bu
A single whitespace characta (usually a newline).

.IP \(bu
A rasta of Height rows, up in order from top ta bottom.  Each row
consistz of Width pixels, up in order from left ta right.  Each pixel is
a triplet of red, green, n' blue samples, up in dat order n' shit.  Each sample
is represented up in pure binary by either 1 or 2 bytes.  If tha Maxval
is less than 256, it is 1 byte.  Otherwise, it is 2 bytes.  Da most
significant byte is first.
.sp
A row of a image is horizontal. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  A column is vertical. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack.  Da pixels
in tha image is square n' contiguous.
.sp
In tha raster, tha sample joints is 'nonlinear.' They are
proportionizzle ta tha intensitizzle of tha ITU-R Recommendation BT.709 red,
green, n' blue up in tha pixel, adjusted by tha BT.709 gamma transfer
function. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  (That transfer function specifies a gamma number of 2.2 and
has a linear section fo' lil' small-ass intensities).  A value of Maxval for
all three samplez represents CIE D65 white n' da most thugged-out intense color
in tha color universe of which tha image is part (the color universe
is all tha flavas up in all images ta which dis image might be
compared).
.sp
ITU-R Recommendation BT.709 be a renamin of tha forma CCIR
Recommendation 709.  When CCIR was absorbed tha fuck into its parent
organization, tha ITU, ca. 2000, tha standard was renamed. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  This
document once referred ta tha standard as CIE Rec. 709 yo, but it aint
clear now dat CIE eva sponsored such a standard.
.sp
Note dat another ghettofab color space is tha newer sRGB.  A common
variation on PPM is ta substitute dis color space fo' tha one specified.
.sp
Note dat a cold-ass lil common variation on tha PPM format is ta have tha sample
values be 'linear,' i.e. as specified above except without
the gamma adjustment.  \fBpnmgamma\fP takes such a PPM variant as
input n' produces a legit PPM as output.


.PP
Strings startin wit '#' may be comments, tha same as
with
.BR PBM (1)
.
.PP
Note dat you can use \fBpamdepth\fP ta convert between a the
format wit 1 byte per sample n' tha one wit 2 bytes per sample.
.PP
There is straight-up another version of tha PPM format dat is fairly
rare: 'plain' PPM format.  Da format above, which generally
considered tha aiiight one, is known as tha 'raw' PPM format.
See
.BR pbm (1)
 fo' some commentary on how tha fuck plain
and raw formats relate ta one another n' how tha fuck ta use em.
.PP
Da difference up in tha plain format is:


.TP
-
There is exactly one image up in a gangbangin' file.
.TP
-
Da magic number is P3 instead of P6.
.TP
-
Each sample up in tha rasta is represented as a ASCII decimal number
(of arbitrary size).
.TP
-
Each sample up in tha rasta has white space before n' afta dat shit.  There must
be at least one characta of white space between any two samplez yo, but there
is no maximum.  There is no particular separation of one pixel from another --
just tha required separation between tha blue sample of one pixel from the
red sample of tha next pixel.
.TP
-
No line should be longer than 70 characters.

.PP
Here be a example of a lil' small-ass image up in dis format.
.nf

.fi
.PP
There be a newline characta all up in tha end of each of these lines.
.PP
Programs dat read dis format should be as lenient as possible,
acceptin anythang dat looks remotely like a PPM image.
.PP
All charactas referred ta herein is encoded up in ASCII.
\&'newline' refers tha characta known up in ASCII as Line
Feed or LF.  A 'white space' characta is space, CR, LF,
TAB, VT, or FF (I.e. what tha fuck tha ANSI standard C isspace() function
calls white space).


.UN compatibility
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.PP
Before April 2000, a raw format PPM file could not gotz a maxval pimped outer
than 255.  Hence, it could not have mo' than one byte per sample.  Old
programs may depend on all dis bullshit.
.PP
Before July 2000, there could be at most one image up in a PPM file.  As
a result, most tools ta process PPM filez ignore (and don't read) any
data afta tha straight-up original gangsta image.
