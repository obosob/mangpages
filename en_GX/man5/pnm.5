.SH NAME

pnm - Netpbm superformat

.UN description
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Da PNM format is just a abstraction of tha PBM, PGM, n' PPM
formats, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  I.e. tha name 'PNM' refers collectively to
PBM, PGM, n' PPM.
.PP
Da name 'PNM' be a acronym derived from 'Portable
Any Map.' This derivation make mo' sense if you consider
it up in tha context of tha other Netpbm format names: PBM, PGM, n' PPM.
.PP
Da mo' general term 'Netpbm format' refers ta tha PNM
formats plus PAM.
.PP
PNM is principally used with
.BR Netpbm (1)
.
.PP
Note dat besides bein namez of formats, PBM, PGM, PPM, n' PNM
are also classez of programs.  A PNM program can take PBM, PGM, or PPM
input.  Thatz not a god damn thang special -- a PPM program can like a muthafucka.  But a PNM
program can often produce multiple output formats as well, n' a PNM
program can peep tha difference between PBM, PGM, n' PPM input and
respond ta each differently whereas a PPM program sees every last muthafuckin thang as
if it was PPM.  This is discussed mo' in
.BR the
description of tha netpbm programs (1)
.
.PP
\&'pnm' also appears up in tha namez of da most thugged-out general
.BR Netpbm library routines (1)
, a shitload of which aren't even
related ta tha PNM format.
