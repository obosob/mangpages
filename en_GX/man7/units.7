Da symbol fo' micro is tha Greek letta mu, often freestyled u
in a ASCII context where dis Greek letta aint available.

Da binary prefixes resemble tha decimal ones,
but have a additionizzle \(aqi\(aq
(and "Ki" starts wit a cold-ass lil capital \(aqK\(aq).
Da names is formed by takin the
first syllable of tha namez of tha decimal prefix wit roughly tha same
size, followed by "bi" fo' "binary".

Before these binary prefixes was introduced, dat shiznit was fairly
common ta use k=1000 n' K=1024, just like b=bit, B=byte.
Unfortunately, tha M is capital already, n' cannot be
capitalized ta indicate binary-ness.

At first dat didn't matta too much, since memory modules
and disks came up in sizes dat was powerz of two, so everyone
knew dat up in such contexts "kilobyte" n' "megabyte" meant
1024 n' 1048576 bytes, respectively.
What originally was a
sloppy use of tha prefixes "kilo" n' "mega" started ta become
regarded as tha "real legit meaning" when computas was involved.
But then disk technologizzle chizzled, n' disk sizes became arbitrary numbers.
Afta a period of uncertainty all disk manufacturers settled on the
standard, namely k=1000, M=1000k, G=1000M.

Da thang was messy: up in tha 14k4 modems, k=1000; up in tha 1.44MB
.\" also common: 14.4k modem
diskettes, M=1024000; etc.
In 1998 tha IEC approved tha standard
that defines tha binary prefixes given above, enablin people
to be precise n' unambiguous.

Thus, todizzle, MB = 1000000B n' MiB = 1048576B.

In tha free software ghetto programs is slowly
bein chizzled ta conform.
