XkbAllocDeviceInfo \- Obtain a XkbDeviceInfoRec structure
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "unsigned int " "n_buttons" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int " "sz_leds" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- device_spec
device ID wit which structure is ghon be used
.TP
.I \- n_buttons
number of button actions ta allocate space for
.TP
.I \- sz_leds
number of LED feedbacks ta allocate space for
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbAllocDeviceInfo 
allocates space fo' a XkbDeviceInfoRec structure n' initializes dat structurez 
.I device_spec 
field wit tha thang ID specified by 
.I device_spec. 
If 
.I n_buttons 
is nonzero, 
.I n_buttons 
XkbActions is linked tha fuck into tha XkbDeviceInfoRec structure n' initialized ta zero. If 
.I sz_ledz 
is nonzero, 
.I sz_ledz 
XkbDeviceLedInfoRec structures is also allocated n' linked tha fuck into tha XkbDeviceInfoRec structure. If 
you request XkbDeviceLedInfoRec structures be allocated rockin dis request, you must initialize dem 
explicitly.

To obtain a XkbDeviceLedInfoRec structure, use 
.I XkbAllocDeviceLedInfo.
.SH STRUCTURES
.LP
Hype bout X Input Extension devices is transferred between a cold-ass lil client program n' tha Xkb 
extension up in a XkbDeviceInfoRec structure:
