.SH NAME
gnutls_record_recv_seq \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "ssize_t gnutls_record_recv_seq(gnutls_session_t " session ", void * " data ", size_t " data_size ", unsigned char * " seq ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "void * data" 12
the buffer dat tha data is ghon be read into
.IP "size_t data_size" 12
the number of axed bytes
.IP "unsigned char * seq" 12
is tha packetz 64\-bit sequence number n' shit. Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Should have space fo' 8 bytes.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function is tha same ol' dirty as \fBgnutls_record_recv()\fP, except that
it returns up in addizzle ta data, tha sequence number of tha data.
This is useful up in DTLS where record packets might be received
out\-of\-order n' shit. Da returned 8\-byte sequence number be an
integer up in big\-endian format n' should be
treated as a unique message identification. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. 
.SH "RETURNS"
Da number of bytes received n' zero on EOF.  A negative
error code is returned up in case of a error. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  Da number of bytes
