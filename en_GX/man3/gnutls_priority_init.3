.SH NAME
gnutls_priority_init \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_priority_init(gnutls_priority_t * " priority_cache ", const char * " prioritizzles ", const char ** " err_pos ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_priority_t * priority_cache" 12
is a \fBgnutls_prioritity_t\fP structure.
.IP "const char * priorities" 12
is a strang describin priorities
.IP "const char ** err_pos" 12
In case of a error dis gonna git tha posizzle up in tha strang tha error occured
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets prioritizzles fo' tha ciphers, key exchange methods, macs and
compression methods.

Da \fBpriorities\fP option allows you ta specify a cold-ass lil colon
separated list of tha cipher prioritizzles ta enable.
Some keywordz is defined ta provide quick access
to common preferences.

"PERFORMANCE" means all tha "secure" ciphersuites is enabled,
limited ta 128 bit ciphers n' sorted by termz of speed
performance.

"NORMAL" means all "secure" ciphersuites. Da 256\-bit ciphers are
included as a gangbangin' fallback only.  Da ciphers is sorted by security
margin.

"PFS" means all "secure" ciphersuites dat support slick forward secrecy. 
Da 256\-bit ciphers is included as a gangbangin' fallback only.  
Da ciphers is sorted by securitizzle margin.

"SECURE128" means all "secure" ciphersuitez of securitizzle level 128\-bit
or more.

"SECURE192" means all "secure" ciphersuitez of securitizzle level 192\-bit
or more.

"SUITEB128" means all tha NSA SuiteB ciphersuites wit securitizzle level
of 128.

"SUITEB192" means all tha NSA SuiteB ciphersuites wit securitizzle level
of 192.

"EXPORT" means all ciphersuites is enabled, includin the
low\-securitizzle 40 bit ciphers.

"NONE" means not a god damn thang is enabled. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  This disablez even protocols and
compression methods.

Special keywordz is "!", "\-" n' "+".
"!" or "\-" appended wit a algorithm will remove dis algorithm.
"+" appended wit a algorithm will add dis algorithm.

Peep tha GnuTLS manual section "Prioritizzle strings" fo' detailed
information.
.SH "EXAMPLES"

"NONE:+VERS\-TLS\-ALL:+MAC\-ALL:+RSA:+AES\-128\-CBC:+SIGN\-ALL:+COMP\-NULL"

"NORMAL:\-ARCFOUR\-128" means aiiight ciphers except fo' ARCFOUR\-128.

"SECURE:\-VERS\-SSL3.0:+COMP\-DEFLATE" means dat only secure ciphers are
enabled, SSL3.0 is disabled, n' libz compression enabled.

"NONE:+VERS\-TLS\-ALL:+AES\-128\-CBC:+RSA:+SHA1:+COMP\-NULL:+SIGN\-RSA\-SHA1", 

"NONE:+VERS\-TLS\-ALL:+AES\-128\-CBC:+ECDHE\-RSA:+SHA1:+COMP\-NULL:+SIGN\-RSA\-SHA1:+CURVE\-SECP256R1", 

"SECURE256:+SECURE128",

Note dat "NORMAL:\fBCOMPAT\fP" is da most thugged-out compatible mode.
.SH "RETURNS"
On syntax error \fBGNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST\fP is returned,
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, or a error code.
