.BI "int gnutls_x509_crt_set_issuer_dn_by_oid(gnutls_x509_crt_t " crt ", const char * " oid ", unsigned int " raw_flag ", const void * " name ", unsigned int " sizeof_name ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS

.IP "const char * oid" 12

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will set tha part of tha name of tha Certificate
issuer, specified by tha given OID.  Da input strang should be
ASCII or UTF\-8 encoded.

Some helper macros wit ghettofab OIDs can be found up in gnutls/x509.h
With dis function you can only set tha known OIDs. Yo ass can test
for known OIDs rockin \fBgnutls_x509_dn_oid_known()\fP. For OIDs dat are
not known (by gnutls) you should properly DER encode yo' data,
and call dis function wit  \fIraw_flag\fP set.

Normally you do not need ta booty-call dis function, since tha signing
operation will copy tha signerz name as tha issuer of the
certificate.
