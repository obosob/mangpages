.SH NAME
gnutls_record_recv \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "ssize_t gnutls_record_recv(gnutls_session_t " session ", void * " data ", size_t " data_size ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "void * data" 12
the buffer dat tha data is ghon be read into
.IP "size_t data_size" 12
the number of axed bytes
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function has tha similar semantics wit \fBrecv()\fP.  Da only
difference is dat it accepts a GnuTLS session, n' uses different
error codes.
In tha special case dat a server requests a renegotiation, the
client may receive a error code of \fBGNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE\fP.  This
message may be simply ignored, replied wit a alert
\fBGNUTLS_A_NO_RENEGOTIATION\fP, or replied wit a freshly smoked up handshake,
dependin on tha clientz will.
If \fBEINTR\fP is returned by tha internal push function (the default
is \fBrecv()\fP) then \fBGNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED\fP is ghon be returned. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  If
\fBGNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED\fP or \fBGNUTLS_E_AGAIN\fP is returned, you must
call dis function again n' again n' again ta git tha data.  See also
\fBgnutls_record_get_direction()\fP.
A server may also receive \fBGNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE\fP when a cold-ass lil client has
initiated a handshake. In dat case tha server can only initiate a
handshake or terminizzle tha connection.
.SH "RETURNS"
Da number of bytes received n' zero on EOF (for stream
connections).  A wack error code is returned up in case of a error. Shiiit, dis aint no joke.  
Da number of bytes received might be less than tha axed  \fIdata_size\fP .
