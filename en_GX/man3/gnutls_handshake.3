.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function do tha handshake of tha TLS/SSL protocol, and
initializes tha TLS connection.

This function will fail if any problem is encountered, n' will
return a wack error code. In case of a cold-ass lil client, if tha client
has axed ta resume a session yo, but tha server couldn't, then a
full handshake is ghon be performed.

Da non\-fatal errors like fuckin \fBGNUTLS_E_AGAIN\fP and
\fBGNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED\fP interrupt tha handshake procedure, which
should be resumed later n' shit.  Call dis function again, until it
returns 0; cf.  \fBgnutls_record_get_direction()\fP and
\fBgnutls_error_is_fatal()\fP.

If dis function is called by a server afta a rehandshake request
then \fBGNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA\fP or
\fBGNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED\fP may be returned. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka!  Note dat these
are non fatal errors, only up in tha specific case of a rehandshake.
Their meanin is dat tha client rejected tha rehandshake request or
in tha case of \fBGNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA\fP it might also mean that
some data was pending.
