.SH NAME
gnutls_pkcs12_simple_parse \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/pkcs12.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_pkcs12_simple_parse(gnutls_pkcs12_t " p12 ", const char * " password ", gnutls_x509_privkey_t * " key ", gnutls_x509_crt_t ** " chain ", unsigned int * " chain_len ", gnutls_x509_crt_t ** " extra_certs ", unsigned int * " extra_certs_len ", gnutls_x509_crl_t * " crl ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_pkcs12_t p12" 12
the PKCS12 blob.
.IP "const char * password" 12
optionizzle password used ta decrypt PKCS12 blob, bags n' keys.
.IP "gnutls_x509_privkey_t * key" 12
a structure ta store tha parsed private key.
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t ** chain" 12
the correspondin ta key certificate chain (may be \fBNULL\fP)
.IP "unsigned int * chain_len" 12
will be updated wit tha number of additionizzle (may be \fBNULL\fP)
.IP "gnutls_x509_crt_t ** extra_certs" 12
optionizzle pointa ta receive a array of additional
certificates found up in tha PKCS12 blob (may be \fBNULL\fP).
.IP "unsigned int * extra_certs_len" 12
will be updated wit tha number of additional
certs (may be \fBNULL\fP).
.IP "gnutls_x509_crl_t * crl" 12
an optionizzle structure ta store tha parsed CRL (may be \fBNULL\fP).
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
should be zero or one of GNUTLS_PKCS12_SP_*
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function parses a PKCS12 blob up in  \fIp12blob\fP n' extracts the
private key, tha correspondin certificate chain, n' any additional
certificates n' a CRL.

Da  \fIextra_certs_ret\fP n'  \fIextra_certs_len\fP parametas is optional
and both may be set ta \fBNULL\fP. If either is non\-\fBNULL\fP, then both must
be set.

Encrypted PKCS12 bags n' PKCS8 private keys is supported. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time.  However,
only password based security, n' tha same password fo' all
operations, is supported.

A PKCS12 file may contain nuff keys and/or certificates, n' there
is no way ta identify which key/certificate pair you want.  You
should make shizzle tha PKCS12 file only contain one key/certificate
pair and/or one CRL.

It be believed dat tha limitationz of dis function is acceptable
for common usage, n' dat any mo' flexibilitizzle would introduce
complexitizzle dat would make it harder ta use dis functionalitizzle at
all.

If tha provided structure has encrypted fieldz but no password
is provided then dis function returns \fBGNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED\fP.

Note dat normally tha chain constructed do not include self signed
certificates, ta comply wit TLS' requirements, n' you can put dat on yo' toast. If, however, tha flag 
\fBGNUTLS_PKCS12_SP_INCLUDE_SELF_SIGNED\fP is specified then
self signed certificates is ghon be included up in tha chain.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, otherwise a
negatizzle error value.
