.SH NAME
fclose \- close a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <stdio.h>
.sp
.BI "int fclose(FILE *" fp );
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR fclose ()
function flushes tha stream pointed ta by
.I fp
(writin any buffered output data using
.BR fflush (3))
and closes tha underlyin file descriptor.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful completion 0 is returned.
Otherwise,
.B EOF
is returned and
.I errno
is set ta indicate tha error.
In either case any further access
(includin another call to
.BR fclose ())
to tha stream thangs up in dis biatch up in undefined behavior.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EBADF
Da file descriptor underlying
.I fp
is not valid.
.\"  This error cannot occur unless yo ass is mixin ANSI C stdio operations and
.\"  low-level file operations on tha same stream. If you do git dis error,
.\"  you must have closed tha streamz low-level file descriptor using
.\"  suttin' like close(fileno(fp)).
.PP
The
.BR fclose ()
function may also fail n' set
.I errno
for any of tha errors specified fo' tha routines
.BR close (2),
.BR write (2)
or
.BR fflush (3).
.SH CONFORMING TO
C89, C99.
.SH NOTES
Note that
.BR fclose ()
only flushes tha user-space buffers provided by the
C library.
To ensure dat tha data is physically stored
on disk tha kernel buffers must be flushed too, fo' example, with
.BR sync (2)
or
.BR fsync (2).
