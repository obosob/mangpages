.SH NAME
gnutls_dh_set_prime_bits \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_dh_set_prime_bits(gnutls_session_t " session ", unsigned int " bits ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "unsigned int bits" 12
is tha number of bits
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets tha number of bits, fo' use up in a Diffie\-Hellman
key exchange.  This is used both up in DH ephemeral n' DH anonymous
cipher suites.  This will set tha minimum size of tha prime that
will be used fo' tha handshake.

In tha client side it sets tha minimum accepted number of bits, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  If
a server sendz a prime wit less bits than that
\fBGNUTLS_E_DH_PRIME_UNACCEPTABLE\fP is ghon be returned by tha handshake.

Note dat joints lower than 512 bits may allow decryption of the
exchanged data.

Da function has no effect up in server side.

Note dat since 3.1.7 dis function is deprecated. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time. Da minimum
number of bits is set by tha prioritizzle strang level.
Also dis function must be called afta \fBgnutls_priority_set_direct()\fP
or tha set value may be overridden by tha selected prioritizzle options.
