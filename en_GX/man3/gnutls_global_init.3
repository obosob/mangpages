.SH NAME
gnutls_global_init \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_global_init( " void ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP " void" 12
.SH "DESCRIPTION"

This function initializes tha global data ta defaults, n' you can put dat on yo' toast.  
In order ta free resources you may call \fBgnutls_global_deinit()\fP 
when gnutls usage is no longer needed.

Note dat dis function will also initialize tha underlyin crypto
backend, if it has not been initialized before.  

This function increments a global counter, so that
\fBgnutls_global_deinit()\fP only releases resources when it has been
called as nuff times as \fBgnutls_global_init()\fP.  This is useful when
GnuTLS is used by mo' than one library up in a application. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch.  This
function can be called nuff times yo, but will only do suttin' the
first time.

Note biaaatch!  This function aint thread safe.  If two threadz call this
function simultaneously, they can cause a race between checking
the global counta n' incrementin it, causin both threadz to
execute tha library initialization code.  That would lead ta a
memory leak.  To handle this, yo' application could invoke this
function afta aquirin a thread mutex.  To ignore tha potential
memory leak be also a option.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned,
otherwise a wack error code is returned.
