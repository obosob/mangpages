.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR readlinkat ()
system call operates up in exactly tha same way as
.BR readlink (2),
except fo' tha differences busted lyrics bout up in dis manual page.

If tha pathname given in
.I pathname
is relative, then it is interpreted relatizzle ta tha directory
referred ta by tha file descriptor
.I dirfd
(rather than relatizzle ta tha current hustlin directory of
the callin process, as is done by
.BR readlink (2)
for a relatizzle pathname).

If
.I pathname
is relatizzle and
.I dirfd
is tha special value
.BR AT_FDCWD ,
then
.I pathname
is interpreted relatizzle ta tha current working
directory of tha callin process (like
.BR readlink (2)).

If
.I pathname
is absolute, then
.I dirfd
is ignored.

Since Linux 2.6.39,
.\" commit 65cfc6722361570bfe255698d9cd4dccaf47570d
.I pathname
can be a empty string,
in which case tha call operates on tha file referred ta by
.IR dirfd
(which may done been obtained rockin the
.BR open (2)
.B O_PATH
flag).
In dis case,
.I dirfd
can refer ta any type of file, not just a gangbangin' finger-lickin' directory.

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success,
.BR readlinkat ()
returns tha number of bytes placed in
.IR buf .
On error, \-1 is returned and
.I errno
is set ta indicate tha error.
.SH ERRORS
Da same errors dat occur for
.BR readlink (2)
can also occur for
.BR readlinkat ().
Da followin additionizzle errors can occur for
.BR readlinkat ():
.TP
.B EBADF
.I dirfd
is not a valid file descriptor.
.TP
.B ENOTDIR
.I pathname
is relatizzle and
.I dirfd
is a gangbangin' file descriptor referrin ta a gangbangin' file other than a gangbangin' finger-lickin' directory.
.SH VERSIONS
.BR readlinkat ()
was added ta Linux up in kernel 2.6.16;
library support was added ta glibc up in version 2.4.
.SH CONFORMING TO
POSIX.1-2008.
.SH NOTES
See
.BR openat (2)

.BR readlinkat ().
