.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Da \fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP() functions shall create
a freshly smoked up process (child process) from tha specified
process image. Da freshly smoked up process image shall be constructed from a regular
executable file called tha freshly smoked up process image file.
.LP
When a C program is executed as tha result of dis call, it shall
be entered as a C-language function call as bigs up:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBint main(int\fP \fIargc\fP\fB, char *\fP\fIargv\fP\fB[]);
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
where \fIargc\fP is tha argument count n' \fIargv\fP be a array
of characta pointas ta tha arguments theyselves. In
addition, tha followin variable:
.sp
.RS
.nf

\fBextern char **environ;
\fP
.fi
.RE
.LP
shall be initialized as a pointa ta a array of characta pointers
to tha environment strings.
.LP
Da argument \fIargv\fP be a array of characta pointas ta null-terminated
strings. Da last gangmember of dis array shall be a
null pointa n' aint counted up in \fIargc\fP. These strings constitute
the argument list available ta tha freshly smoked up process image. The
value up in \fIargv\fP[0] should point ta a gangbangin' filename dat be associated
with tha process image bein started by the
\fIposix_spawn\fP() or \fIposix_spawnp\fP() function.
.LP
Da argument \fIenvp\fP be a array of characta pointas ta null-terminated
strings. These strings constitute tha environment
for tha freshly smoked up process image. Da environment array is terminated by
a null pointer.
.LP
Da number of bytes available fo' tha lil pimp process' combined argument
and environment lists is {ARG_MAX}. Da implementation
shall specify up in tha system documentation (see tha Base Definitions
volume of IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Chapta 2, Conformance) whether
any list overhead, like fuckin length lyrics, null terminators,
pointers, or alignment bytes, is included up in dis total.
.LP
Da \fIpath\fP argument ta \fIposix_spawn\fP() be a pathname that
identifies tha freshly smoked up process image file ta execute.
.LP
Da \fIfile\fP parameta ta \fIposix_spawnp\fP() shall be used to
construct a pathname dat identifies tha freshly smoked up process image
file. If tha \fIfile\fP parameta gotz nuff a slash character, the
\fIfile\fP parameta shall be used as tha pathname fo' tha new
process image file. Otherwise, tha path prefix fo' dis file shall
be obtained by a search of tha directories passed as the
environment variable \fIPATH\fP (see tha Base Definitions volume of
IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001, Chapta 8, Environment Variables). If this
environment variable aint defined, tha thangs up in dis biatch of
the search is implementation-defined.
.LP
If \fIfile_actions\fP be a null pointer, then file descriptors open
in tha callin process shall remain open up in tha child
process, except fo' dem whose close-on- \fIexec\fP flag FD_CLOEXEC
is set (see \fIfcntl\fP()). For dem file descriptors dat remain
open, all attributez of tha correspondin open file
descriptions, includin file locks (see \fIfcntl\fP()), shall remain
unchanged.
.LP
If \fIfile_actions\fP aint NULL, then tha file descriptors open
in tha lil pimp process shall be dem open up in tha calling
process as modified by tha spawn file actions object pointed ta by
\fIfile_actions\fP n' tha FD_CLOEXEC flag of each remaining
open file descriptor afta tha spawn file actions done been processed.
Da effectizzle order of processin tha spawn file actions
shall be:
.IP " 1." 4
Da set of open file descriptors fo' tha lil pimp process shall initially
be tha same set as is open fo' tha callin process fo' realz. All
attributez of tha correspondin open file descriptions, including
file locks (see \fIfcntl\fP()), shall
remain unchanged.
.LP
.IP " 2." 4
Da signal mask, signal default actions, n' tha effectizzle user and
group IDs fo' tha lil pimp process shall be chizzled as
specified up in tha attributes object referenced by \fIattrp\fP.
.LP
.IP " 3." 4
Da file actions specified by tha spawn file actions object shall
be performed up in tha order up in which they was added ta the
spawn file actions object.
.LP
.IP " 4." 4
Any file descriptor dat has its FD_CLOEXEC flag set (see \fIfcntl\fP()
) shall be closed.
.LP
.LP
Da \fBposix_spawnattr_t\fP spawn attributes object type is defined
in \fI<spawn.h>\fP. Well shiiiit, it shall contain at least tha attributes defined
below.
.LP
If tha POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is set up in tha \fIspawn-flags\fP
attribute of tha object referenced by \fIattrp\fP, n' the
\fIspawn-pgroup\fP attribute of tha same object is non-zero, then
the childz process crew shall be as specified up in the
\fIspawn-pgroup\fP attribute of tha object referenced by \fIattrp\fP.
.LP
As a special case, if tha POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag is set up in the
\fIspawn-flags\fP attribute of tha object referenced by
\fIattrp\fP, n' tha \fIspawn-pgroup\fP attribute of tha same object
is set ta zero, then tha lil pimp shall be up in a freshly smoked up process
group wit a process crew ID equal ta its process ID.
.LP
If tha POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP flag aint set up in tha \fIspawn-flags\fP
attribute of tha object referenced by \fIattrp\fP, the
new lil pimp process shall inherit tha parentz process group.
.LP
If
the POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM flag is set up in tha \fIspawn-flags\fP
attribute of tha object referenced by \fIattrp\fP yo, but
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER aint set, tha freshly smoked up process image shall initially
have tha schedulin policy of tha callin process with
the schedulin parametas specified up in tha \fIspawn-schedparam\fP
attribute of tha object referenced by \fIattrp\fP.
.LP
If tha POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER flag is set up in tha \fIspawn-flags\fP
attribute of tha object referenced by \fIattrp\fP
(regardless of tha settin of tha POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM flag),
the freshly smoked up process image shall initially have tha schedulin policy
specified up in tha \fIspawn-schedpolicy\fP attribute of tha object referenced
by \fIattrp\fP n' tha schedulin parameters
specified up in tha \fIspawn-schedparam\fP attribute of tha same object.
.LP
Da POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS flag up in tha \fIspawn-flags\fP attribute of
the object referenced by \fIattrp\fP governs tha effective
user ID of tha lil pimp process. If dis flag aint set, tha lil pimp process
shall inherit tha parent process' effectizzle user ID. If
this flag is set, tha lil pimp process' effectizzle user ID shall be reset
to tha parentz real user ID. In either case, if the
set-user-ID mode bit of tha freshly smoked up process image file is set, tha effective
user ID of tha lil pimp process shall become dat file's
balla ID before tha freshly smoked up process image begins execution.
.LP
Da POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS flag up in tha \fIspawn-flags\fP attribute of
the object referenced by \fIattrp\fP also governs the
effectizzle crew ID of tha lil pimp process. If dis flag aint set,
the lil pimp process shall inherit tha parent process' effective
group ID. If dis flag is set, tha lil pimp process' effectizzle group
ID shall be reset ta tha parentz real crew ID. In either case,
if tha set-group-ID mode bit of tha freshly smoked up process image file is set,
the effectizzle crew ID of tha lil pimp process shall become that
filez crew ID before tha freshly smoked up process image begins execution.
.LP
If tha POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK flag is set up in tha \fIspawn-flags\fP
attribute of tha object referenced by \fIattrp\fP, the
child process shall initially have tha signal mask specified up in the
\fIspawn-sigmask\fP attribute of tha object referenced by
\fIattrp\fP.
.LP
If tha POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag is set up in tha \fIspawn-flags\fP
attribute of tha object referenced by \fIattrp\fP, the
signals specified up in tha \fIspawn-sigdefault\fP attribute of tha same
object shall be set ta they default actions up in tha child
process. Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Signals set ta tha default action up in tha parent process shall
be set ta tha default action up in tha lil pimp process.
.LP
Signals set ta be caught by tha callin process shall be set ta the
default action up in tha lil pimp process.
.LP
Except fo' SIGCHLD, signals set ta be ignored by tha callin process
image shall be set ta be ignored by tha lil pimp process,
unless otherwise specified by tha POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag being
set up in tha \fIspawn-flags\fP attribute of tha object referenced
by \fIattrp\fP n' tha signals bein indicated up in tha \fIspawn-sigdefault\fP
attribute of tha object referenced by
\fIattrp\fP.
.LP
If tha SIGCHLD signal is set ta be ignored by tha callin process,
it is unspecified whether tha SIGCHLD signal is set ta be
ignored or ta tha default action up in tha lil pimp process, unless otherwise
specified by tha POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF flag bein set in
the \fIspawn_flags\fP attribute of tha object referenced by \fIattrp\fP
and tha SIGCHLD signal bein indicated up in the
\fIspawn_sigdefault\fP attribute of tha object referenced by \fIattrp\fP.
.LP
If tha value of tha \fIattrp\fP pointa is NULL, then tha default
values is used.
.LP
All process attributes, other than dem hyped up by tha attributes
set up in tha object referenced by \fIattrp\fP as specified
above or by tha file descriptor manipulations specified up in \fIfile_actions\fP,
shall step tha fuck up in tha freshly smoked up process image as though \fIfork\fP() had been
called ta create a cold-ass lil lil pimp process n' then a gangmember of tha \fIexec\fP
family of functions had been called by tha lil pimp process ta execute
the freshly smoked up process
image.
.LP
It be implementation-defined whether tha fork handlezs is run when
\fIposix_spawn\fP() or \fIposix_spawnp\fP() is called. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! 
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP()
shall return tha process ID of tha lil pimp process to
the parent process, up in tha variable pointed ta by a non-NULL \fIpid\fP
argument, n' shall return zero as tha function return
value. Otherwise, no lil pimp process shall be pimped, tha value stored
into tha variable pointed ta by a non-NULL \fIpid\fP is
unspecified, n' a error number shall be returned as tha function
return value ta indicate tha error. Shiiit, dis aint no joke. If tha \fIpid\fP argument
is a null pointer, tha process ID of tha lil pimp aint returned to
the caller.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
Da \fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP() functions may fail
if:
.TP 7
.B EINVAL
Da value specified by \fIfile_actions\fP or \fIattrp\fP is invalid.
.sp
.LP
If dis error occurs afta tha callin process successfully returns
from tha \fIposix_spawn\fP() or \fIposix_spawnp\fP()
function, tha lil pimp process may exit wit exit status 127.
.LP
If \fIposix_spawn\fP() or \fIposix_spawnp\fP() fail fo' any of the
reasons dat would cause \fIfork\fP() or one of tha \fIexec\fP crew
of functions to
fail, a error value shall be returned as busted lyrics bout by \fIfork\fP()
and \fIexec\fP, respectively (or, if tha error occurs afta tha calling
process successfully returns, the
child process shall exit wit exit status 127).
.LP
If POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP is set up in tha \fIspawn-flags\fP attribute
of tha object referenced by \fIattrp\fP, and
\fIposix_spawn\fP() or \fIposix_spawnp\fP() fails while changin the
childz process group, a error value shall be returned as
busted lyrics bout by \fIsetpgid\fP() (or, if tha error occurs afta tha calling
process
successfully returns, tha lil pimp process shall exit wit exit status
127).
.LP
If
POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM is set n' POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER is not
set up in tha \fIspawn-flags\fP attribute of tha object
referenced by \fIattrp\fP, then if \fIposix_spawn\fP() or \fIposix_spawnp\fP()
fails fo' any of tha reasons dat would cause \fIsched_setparam\fP()
to fail, a error value shall be returned as busted lyrics bout by \fIsched_setparam\fP()
(or, if tha error occurs afta tha callin process successfully
returns, tha lil pimp process shall exit wit exit status 127).
.LP
If POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER is set up in tha \fIspawn-flags\fP attribute
of tha object referenced by \fIattrp\fP, n' if
\fIposix_spawn\fP() or \fIposix_spawnp\fP() fails fo' any of tha reasons
that would cause \fIsched_setscheduler\fP() ta fail, a error value
shall be returned as busted lyrics bout by \fIsched_setscheduler\fP() (or,
if tha error occurs afta tha callin process
successfully returns, tha lil pimp process shall exit wit exit status
127). 
.LP
If tha \fIfile_actions\fP argument aint NULL, n' specifies any
\fIclose\fP, \fIdup2\fP, or \fIopen\fP actions ta be
performed, n' if \fIposix_spawn\fP() or \fIposix_spawnp\fP() fails
for any of tha reasons dat would cause \fIclose\fP(), \fIdup2\fP(),
or \fIopen\fP() ta fail, a error value shall be returned as busted lyrics about
by \fIclose\fP(), \fIdup2\fP(), n' \fIopen\fP(), respectively (or,
if tha error occurs afta tha callin process successfully returns,
the lil pimp process shall exit wit exit status 127) fo' realz. An open file action
may, by itself, result up in any of tha errors busted lyrics bout by \fIclose\fP()
or \fIdup2\fP(), up in addizzle ta them
busted lyrics bout by \fIopen\fP().
.LP
\fIDa followin sections is informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
These functions is part of tha Spawn option n' need not be provided
on all implementations.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
Da \fIposix_spawn\fP() function n' its close relation \fIposix_spawnp\fP()
have been introduced ta overcome tha following
perceived bullshit wit \fIfork\fP(): tha \fIfork\fP() function
is hard as fuck or impossible ta implement without swappin or dynamic
address
translation.
.IP " *" 3
Swappin is generally too slow fo' a realtime environment.
.LP
.IP " *" 3
Dynamic address translation aint available everywhere dat POSIX
might be useful.
.LP
.IP " *" 3
Processes is too useful ta simply option outta POSIX whenever it
must run without address translation or other MMU
skillz.
.LP
.LP
Thus, POSIX needz process creation n' file execution primitives that
can be efficiently implemented without address translation
or other MMU skillz.
.LP
Da \fIposix_spawn\fP() function is implementable as a library routine,
but both \fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP()
are designed as kernel operations fo' realz. Also, although they may be a efficient
replacement fo' nuff \fIfork\fP()/ \fIexec\fP pairs, they goal is
to provide useful
process creation primitives fo' systems dat have hang-up with
\fIfork\fP(), not to
provide drop-in replacements fo' \fIfork\fP()/ \fIexec\fP.
.LP
This view of tha role of \fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP()
influenced tha design of they API. Well shiiiit, it do not attempt
to provide tha full functionalitizzle of \fIfork\fP()/ \fIexec\fP up in which
arbitrary user-specified operationz of any sort is permitted between
the creation
of tha lil pimp process n' tha execution of tha freshly smoked up process image; any
attempt ta reach dat level would need ta provide a
programmin language as parameters. Instead, \fIposix_spawn\fP() and
\fIposix_spawnp\fP() is process creation primitives like
the \fIStart_Process\fP n' \fIStart_Process_Search\fP Ada language
bindings package \fIPOSIX_Process_Primitives\fP n' also
like dem up in nuff operatin systems dat is not UNIX systems yo, but
with some POSIX-specific additions.
.LP
To big up its coverage goals, \fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP()
have control of six typez of inheritance: file
descriptors, process crew ID, user n' crew ID, signal mask, scheduling,
and whether each signal ignored up in tha parent will
remain ignored up in tha child, or be reset ta its default action in
the child.
.LP
Control of file descriptors is required ta allow a independently
written lil pimp process image ta access data streams opened by
and even generated or read by tha parent process without bein specifically
coded ta know which parent filez n' file descriptors
are ta be used. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Control of tha process crew ID is required ta control
how tha lil pimp process' thang control relates ta dat of the
parent.
.LP
Control of tha signal mask n' signal defaultin is sufficient to
support tha implementation of \fIsystem\fP() fo' realz. Although support for
\fIsystem\fP() is not
explicitly one of tha goals fo' \fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP(),
it is covered under tha "at least 50%" coverage
goal.
.LP
Da intention is dat tha aiiight file descriptor inheritizzle across
\fIfork\fP(), the
subsequent effect of tha specified spawn file actions, n' tha normal
file descriptor inheritizzle across one of tha \fIexec\fP crew of
functions should straight-up specify open file inheritance. Da implementation
need make
no decisions regardin tha set of open file descriptors when tha child
process image begins execution, dem decisions having
already been made by tha calla n' expressed as tha set of open file
descriptors n' they FD_CLOEXEC flags all up in tha time of the
call n' tha spawn file actions object specified up in tha call. Our thugged-out asses have
been assured dat up in cases where tha POSIX
\fIStart_Process\fP Ada primitives done been implemented up in a library,
this method of controllin file descriptor inheritizzle may
be implemented straight-up doggystyle.
.LP
We can identify nuff muthafuckin problems wit \fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP(),
but there do not step tha fuck up ta be a solution
that introduces fewer problems. Environment modification fo' child
process attributes not specifiable via tha \fIattrp\fP or
\fIfile_actions\fP arguments must be done up in tha parent process, and
since tha parent generally wants ta save its context, it is
more costly than similar functionalitizzle wit \fIfork\fP()/ \fIexec\fP.
It be also fucked up ta modify tha environment of a multi-threaded
process temporarily,
since all threadz must smoke when it is safe fo' tha environment to
be chizzled. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat dis cost is only borne by them
invocationz of \fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP() dat use
the additionizzle functionality. Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Since extensive modifications
are not tha usual case, n' is particularly unlikely up in time-critical
code, keepin much of tha environment control up of
\fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP() be appropriate design.
.LP
Da \fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP() functions do not
have all tha juice of \fIfork\fP()/ \fIexec\fP. This is ta be expected.
Da \fIfork\fP() function be a wonderfully bangin operation. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. We
do not expect ta duplicate its
functionalitizzle up in a simple, fast function wit no special hardware
requirements, n' you can put dat on yo' toast. Well shiiiit, it is worth notin dat \fIposix_spawn\fP() and
\fIposix_spawnp\fP() is straight-up similar ta tha process creation operations
on nuff operatin systems dat is not UNIX systems.
.SS Requirements
.LP
Da requirements fo' \fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP()
are:
.IP " *" 3
They must be implementable without a MMU or unusual hardware.
.LP
.IP " *" 3
They must be compatible wit existin POSIX standards.
.LP
.LP
Additionizzle goals are:
.IP " *" 3
They should be efficiently implementable.
.LP
.IP " *" 3
They should be able ta replace at least 50% of typical executions
of \fIfork\fP().
.LP
.IP " *" 3
A system wit \fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP() n' without
\fIfork\fP()
should be useful, at least fo' realtime applications.
.LP
.IP " *" 3
A system wit \fIfork\fP() n' tha \fIexec\fP crew
should be able ta implement \fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP()
as library routines.
.LP
.SS Two-Syntax
.LP
POSIX \fIexec\fP has nuff muthafuckin callin sequences wit approximately
the same functionality.
These step tha fuck up ta be required fo' compatibilitizzle wit existin practice.
Since tha existin practice fo' tha \fIposix_spawn*\fP() functions
is otherwise substantially unlike POSIX, we feel that
simplicitizzle outweighs compatibility. There are, therefore, only two
names fo' tha \fIposix_spawn*\fP() functions.
.LP
Da parameta list do not differ between \fIposix_spawn\fP() and
\fIposix_spawnp\fP(); \fIposix_spawnp\fP() interprets the
second parameta mo' elaborately than \fIposix_spawn\fP().
.SS Compatibilitizzle wit POSIX.5 (Ada)
.LP
Da \fIStart_Process\fP n' \fIStart_Process_Search\fP procedures
from tha \fIPOSIX_Process_Primitives\fP package from the
Ada language bindin ta POSIX.1 encapsulate \fIfork\fP() n' \fIexec\fP
functionalitizzle up in a manner similar ta dat of \fIposix_spawn\fP() and
\fIposix_spawnp\fP().
Originally, up in keepin wit our simplicitizzle goal, tha standard pimpers
had limited tha capabilitizzlez of \fIposix_spawn\fP() and
\fIposix_spawnp\fP() ta a subset of tha capabilitizzlez of \fIStart_Process\fP
and \fIStart_Process_Search\fP; certain non-default
capabilitizzles was not supported. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! This type'a shiznit happens all tha time. But fuck dat shiznit yo, tha word on tha street is dat based on suggestions by
the ballot crew ta improve file descriptor mappin or drop it,
and on tha lyrics of a Ada Language Bindings hustlin crew member,
the standard pimpers decided dat \fIposix_spawn\fP() and
\fIposix_spawnp\fP() should be sufficiently bangin ta implement
\fIStart_Process\fP n' \fIStart_Process_Search\fP. The
rationale is dat if tha Ada language bindin ta such a primitive
had already been approved as a IEEE standard, there can be
lil justification fo' not approvin tha functionally-equivalent
partz of a C binding. Da only three capabilitizzles provided by
\fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP() dat is not provided
by \fIStart_Process\fP n' \fIStart_Process_Search\fP are
optionally specifyin tha childz process crew ID, tha set of signals
to be reset ta default signal handlin up in tha lil pimp process,
and tha childz schedulin policy n' parameters.
.LP
For tha Ada language bindin fo' \fIStart_Process\fP ta be implemented
with \fIposix_spawn\fP(), dat bindin would need to
explicitly pass a empty signal mask n' tha parentz environment
to \fIposix_spawn\fP() whenever tha calla of
\fIStart_Process\fP allowed these arguments ta default, since \fIposix_spawn\fP()
does not provide such defaults, n' you can put dat on yo' toast. Da mobilitizzle of
\fIStart_Process\fP ta mask user-specified signals durin its execution
is functionally unique ta tha Ada language bindin and
must be dealt wit up in tha bindin separately from tha call ta \fIposix_spawn\fP().
.SS Process Group
.LP
Da process crew inheritizzle field can be used ta join tha child
process wit a existin process group. By assignin a value
of zero ta tha \fIspawn-pgroup\fP attribute of tha object referenced
by \fIattrp\fP, tha \fIsetpgid\fP() mechanizzle will place tha child
process up in a freshly smoked up process group.
.SS Threads
.LP
Without tha \fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP() functions,
systems without address translation can still use threads
to give a abstraction of concurrency. In nuff cases, thread creation
suffices yo, but it aint always a phat substitute. The
\fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP() functions is considerably
"heavier" than thread creation. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. Processes have several
important attributes dat threadz do not. Even without address translation,
a process may have base-and-bound memory protection.
Each process has a process environment includin securitizzle attributes
and file capabilities, n' bangin schedulin attributes.
Processes abstract tha behavior of non-uniform-memory-architecture
multi-processors betta than threads, n' they is more
convenient ta use fo' activitizzles dat is not closely linked.
.LP
Da \fIposix_spawn\fP() n' \fIposix_spawnp\fP() functions may not
brin support fo' multiple processes ta every
configuration. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. Process creation aint tha only piece of operating
system support required ta support multiple processes. Da total
cost of support fo' multiple processes may be like high up in some circumstances.
Existin practice shows dat support fo' multiple
processes is uncommon n' threadz is common among "tiny kernels".
There should, therefore, probably continue ta be AEPs for
operatin systems wit only one process.
.SS Asynchronous Error Notification
.LP
A library implementation of \fIposix_spawn\fP() or \fIposix_spawnp\fP()
may not be able ta detect all possible errors before
it forks tha lil pimp process. IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001 serves up fo' an
error indication returned from a cold-ass lil lil pimp process which
could not successfully complete tha spawn operation via a special
exit status which may be detected rockin tha status value returned
by \fIwait\fP() n' \fIwaitpid\fP().

Da \fIstat_val\fP intercourse n' tha macros used ta interpret it are
not well suited ta tha purpose of returnin API errors,
but they is tha only path available ta a library implementation.
Thus, a implementation may cause tha lil pimp process ta exit with
exit status 127 fo' any error detected durin tha spawn process after
the \fIposix_spawn\fP() or \fIposix_spawnp\fP() function
has successfully returned.
.LP
Da standard pimpers had proposed rockin two additionizzle macros to
interpret \fIstat_val\fP. Da first, WIFSPAWNFAIL, would
have detected a status dat indicated dat tha lil pimp exited cuz
of a error detected durin tha \fIposix_spawn\fP() or
\fIposix_spawnp\fP() operations rather than durin actual execution
of tha lil pimp process image; tha second, WSPAWNERRNO, would
have extracted tha error value if WIFSPAWNFAIL indicated a gangbangin' failure.
Unfortunately, tha ballot crew straight fuckin opposed dis cuz
it would cook up a library implementation of \fIposix_spawn\fP() or \fIposix_spawnp\fP()
dependent on kernel modifications ta \fIwaitpid\fP() ta be able to
embed special shiznit up in \fIstat_val\fP ta indicate a
spawn failure.
.LP
Da 8 bitz of lil pimp process exit status dat is guaranteed by IEEE\ Std\ 1003.1-2001
to be accessible ta tha waiting
parent process is insufficient ta disambiguate a spawn error from
any other kind of error dat may be returned by a arbitrary
process image. No other bitz of tha exit status is required ta be
visible up in \fIstat_val\fP, so these macros could not be
strictly implemented all up in tha library level. Reservin a exit status
of 127 fo' such spawn errors is consistent wit tha use of this
value by \fIsystem\fP() n' \fIpopen\fP() ta signal
failures up in these operations dat occur afta tha function has returned
but before a gangbangin' finger-lickin' dirty-ass shell be able ta execute. Da exit status of
127 do not uniquely identify dis class of error, nor do it provide
any detailed shiznit on tha nature of tha failure. Note
that a kernel implementation of \fIposix_spawn\fP() or \fIposix_spawnp\fP()
is permitted (and encouraged) ta return any possible
error as tha function value, thus providin mo' detailed failure
information ta tha parent process.
.LP
Thus, no special macros is available ta isolate asynchronous \fIposix_spawn\fP()
or \fIposix_spawnp\fP() errors. Instead,
errors detected by tha \fIposix_spawn\fP() or \fIposix_spawnp\fP()
operations up in tha context of tha lil pimp process before tha new
process image executes is reported by settin tha childz exit status
to 127. Da callin process may use tha WIFEXITED and
WEXITSTATUS macros on tha \fIstat_val\fP stored by tha \fIwait\fP()
or \fIwaitpid\fP() functions ta detect spawn failures ta tha extent
that other status joints with
which tha lil pimp process image may exit (before tha parent can conclusively
determine dat tha lil pimp process image has begun
execution) is distinct from exit status 127.
